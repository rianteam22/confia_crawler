  * [#11963](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11963) activates `getElem?_pos` more aggressively, triggered by `c[i]`.
  * [#12028](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12028) gives a simpler semantics to `noncomputable`, improving predictability as well as preparing codegen to be moved into a separate build step without breaking immediate generation of error messages.
  * [#12110](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12110) fixes a SIGFPE crash on `x86_64` when evaluating `(ISize.minValue   / -1 : ISize)`, filling an omission from #11624.
  * [#12159](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12159) makes Std.Do's `post` macro universe polymorphic by expanding to `PUnit.unit` instead of `()`.
  * [#12160](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12160) removes calls to `check` that we expect to pass under normal circumstances. This may be re-added later guarded by a `debug` option.
  * [#12164](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12164) uses the `.inj` theorem in the proof of one direction of the `.injEq` theorem.
  * [#12179](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12179) ensures `isDefEq` does not increase the transparency mode to `.default` when checking whether implicit arguments are definitionally equal. The previous behavior was creating scalability problems in Mathlib. That said, this is a very disruptive change. The previous behavior can be restored using the command

```
set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false

```

  * [#12184](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12184) ensures that the `mspec` tactic does not assign synthetic opaque MVars occurring in the goal, just like the `apply` tactic.
  * [#12190](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12190) adds the `introSubstEq` MetaM tactic, as an optimization over `intro h; subst h` that avoids introducing `h : a = b` if it can be avoided, which is the case when `b` can be reverted without reverting anything else. Speeds up the generation of `injEq` theorem.
  * [#12217](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12217) implements RFC #12216: native computation (`native_decide`, `bv_decide`) is represented in the logic as one axiom per computation, asserting the equality that was obtained from the native computation. `#print axiom` will no longer show `Lean.trustCompiler`, but rather the auto-generated names of these axioms (with, for example, `._native.bv_decide.` in the name). See the RFC for more information.
  * [#12219](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12219) fixes a unification issue that appeared in `Lean.Meta.MkIffOfInductiveProp` machinery that was upstreamed from Mathlib. Inside of `toInductive`, wrong free variables were passed, which made it impossible to perform a unification in certain cases.
  * [#12236](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12236) adds `orElse` combinator to simprocs of `Sym.Simp`.
  * [#12243](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12243) fixes #12240, where `deriving Ord` failed with `Unknown   identifier a✝`.
  * [#12247](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12247) adds the new transparency setting `@[instance_reducible]`. We used to check whether a declaration had `instance` reducibility by using the `isInstance` predicate. However, this was not a robust solution because:
    * We have scoped instances, and `isInstance` returns `true` only if the scope is active.
  * [#12263](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12263) implements the second part of #12247.
  * [#12269](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12269) refines upon #12106, by setting the `isRecursive` env extension after adding the declaration, but before processing attributes like `macro_inline` that want to look at the flag. Fixes #12268.
  * [#12283](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12283) introduces `cbv_opaque` attribute that allows one to mark definitions not to be unfolded by the `cbv` tactic.
  * [#12285](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12285) implements a cache for the positions of class universe level parameters that only appear in output parameter types.
  * [#12286](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12286) ensures the type resolution cache properly caches results for type classe containing output parameters.
  * [#12324](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12324) adds a default `Inhabited` instance to `Theorem` type.
  * [#12329](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12329) adds the option `doc.verso.module`. If set, it controls whether module docstrings use Verso syntax. If not set, it defaults to the value of the `doc.verso` option.
  * [#12338](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12338) implements preparatory work for #12179. It implements a new feature in `isDefEq` to ensure it does not increase the transparency level to `.default` when checking definitionally equality of implicit arguments. This transparency level bump was introduced in Lean 3, but it is not a performance issue and is affecting Mathlib. adds the new feature, but it is disabled by default.
  * [#12339](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12339) fixes a diamond problem in delta deriving where instance-implicit class parameters in the derived instance type were using instances synthesized for the underlying type, not the alias type.
  * [#12340](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12340) implements better support for unfolding class fields marked as `reducible`. For example, we want to mark fields that are types such as

```
MonadControlT.stM : Type u -> Type u

```

The motivation is similar to our heuristic that type definitions should be abbreviations. Now, suppose we want to unfold `stM m (ExceptT ε m) α` using the `.reducible` transparency setting, we want the result to be `stM m m   (MonadControl.stM m (ExceptT ε m) α)` instead of `(instMonadControlTOfMonadControl m m (ExceptT ε m)).1 α`. The latter would defeat the intent of marking the field as reducible, since the instance `instMonadControlTOfMonadControl` is `[instance_reducible]` and the resulting term would be stuck when using `.reducible` transparency mode.
  * [#12353](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12353) ressurects the dead trace class `Elab.resume` by redirecting the non-existant `Elab.resuming` to it.
  * [#12355](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12355) adds `isBoolTrueExpr` and `isBoolFalseExpr` functions to `SymM`
  * [#12391](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12391) makes `simpCond` public. It is needed to avoid code duplication in #12361
  * [#12395](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12395) adds `mvcgen` support for specifications in the local context. Example:

```
import Std.Tactic.Do

open Std.Do

set_option mvcgen.warning false

def foo (x : Id Nat → Id Nat) : Id Nat := do
  let r₁ ← x (pure 42)
  let r₂ ← x (pure 26)
  pure (r₁ + r₂)

theorem foo_spec
    (x : Id Nat → Id Nat)
    (x_spec : ∀ (k : Id Nat) (_ : ⦃⌜True⌝⦄ k ⦃⇓r => ⌜r % 2 = 0⌝⦄), ⦃⌜True⌝⦄ x k ⦃⇓r => ⌜r % 2 = 0⌝⦄) :
    ⦃⌜True⌝⦄ foo x ⦃⇓r => ⌜r % 2 = 0⌝⦄ := by
  mvcgen [foo, x_spec] <;> grind

def bar (k : Id Nat) : Id Nat := do
  let r ← k
  if r > 30 then return 12 else return r

example : ⦃⌜True⌝⦄ foo bar ⦃⇓r => ⌜r % 2 = 0⌝⦄ := by
  mvcgen [foo_spec, bar]

```

  * [#12407](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12407) is similar to #12403.
  * [#12416](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12416) makes `Sym.Simp.toBetaApp` public. This is necessary for the refactor of the main `cbv` simproc in #12417.
  * [#12425](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12425) fixes a bug in `mvcgen` caused by incomplete `match` splitting.
  * [#12427](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12427) makes `mvcgen` suggest to use `-trivial` when doing so avoids a recursion depth error.
  * [#12429](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12429) sets the `irreducible` attribute before generating the equations for recursive definitions. This prevents these equations to be marked as `defeq`, which could lead to `simp` generation proofs that do not type check at default transparency.
  * [#12451](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12451) provides the necessary hooks for the new do elaborator to call into the let and match elaborator.
  * [#12459](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12459) adds a new, extensible `do` elaborator. Users can opt into the new elaborator by unsetting the option `backward.do.legacy`.
  * [#12460](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12460) fixes an `AppBuilder` exception in the `cbv` tactic when simplifying projections whose projection function is dependent (closes #12457).
  * [#12507](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12507) fixes #12495 where equational theorem generation fails for structurally recursive definitions using a Box-like wrapper around nested inductives.
  * [#12514](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12514) improves universe level inference for the `inductive` and `structure` commands to be more reliable and to produce better error messages. Recall that the main constraint for inductive types is that if `u` is the universe level for the type and `u > 0`, then each constructor field's universe level `v` satisfies `v ≤ u`, where a **constructor field** is an argument that is not one of the type's **parameters** (recall: the type's parameters are a prefix of the parameters shared by the type former and all the constructors). Given this constraint, the `inductive` elaborator attempts to find reasonable assignments to metavariables that may be present:
    * For the universe level `u`, choosing an assignment that makes this level least is reasonable, provided it is unique.
    * For constructor fields, choosing the unique assignment is usually reasonable.
    * For the type's parameters, promoting level metavariables to new universe level parameters is reasonable.
  * [#12524](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12524) adds `Std.Iter.toHashSet` and variants.
  * [#12525](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12525) adds declaration names to leanchecker error messages to make debugging easier when the kernel rejects a declaration.
  * [#12530](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12530) improves the error message when `mvcgen` cannot resolve the name of a spec theorem.
  * [#12538](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12538) enables `backward.whnf.reducibleClassField` for v4.29.
  * [#12558](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12558) fixes a `(kernel) declaration has metavariables` error that occurred when a `by` tactic was used in a dependent inductive type index that refers to a previous index:

```
axiom P : Prop
axiom Q : P → Prop
-- Previously gave: (kernel) declaration has metavariables 'Foo'
inductive Foo : (h : P) → (Q (by exact h)) → Prop

```

  * [#12564](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12564) fixes `getStuckMVar?` to detect stuck metavariables through auxiliary parent projections created for diamond inheritance. These coercions (e.g., `AddMonoid'.toAddZero'`) are not registered as regular projections because they construct the parent value from individual fields rather than extracting a single field. Previously, `getStuckMVar?` would give up when encountering them, preventing TC synthesis from being triggered.
  * [#12567](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12567) renames `instance_reducible` to `implicit_reducible` and adds a new `backward.isDefEq.implicitBump` option to prepare for treating all implicit arguments uniformly during definitional equality checking.
  * [#12572](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12572) is part 2 of the `implicit_reducible` refactoring (part 1: #12567).
  * [#12574](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12574) renames `SpecTheorems.add` to `SpecTheorems.insert`
  * [#12576](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12576) adds `Sym.mkPatternFromDeclWithKey` to the Sym API to generalize and implement `Sym.mkEqPatternFromDecl`. This is useful to implement custom rewrite-like tactics that want to use `Pattern`s for discrimination tree lookup.
  * [#12621](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12621) fixes a bug where `reduceRecMatcher?` and `reduceProj?` bypassed the `@[cbv_opaque]` attribute. These kernel-level reduction functions use `whnf` internally, which does not know about `@[cbv_opaque]`. This meant `@[cbv_opaque]` values were unfolded when they appeared as match discriminants, recursor major premises, or projection targets. The fix introduces `withCbvOpaqueGuard`, which wraps these calls with `withCanUnfoldPred` to prevent `whnf` from unfolding `@[cbv_opaque]` definitions.
  * [#12633](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12633) makes `isDefEqProj` bump transparency to `.instances` (via `withInstanceConfig`) when comparing the struct arguments of class projections. This makes the behavior consistent with `isDefEqArgs`, which already applies the same bump for instance-implicit parameters when comparing function applications.
  * [#12639](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12639) fixes the interaction between `backward.whnf.reducibleClassField` and `isDefEqDelta`'s argument-comparison heuristic.
  * [#12650](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12650) fixes a performance regression introduced by enabling `backward.whnf.reducibleClassField` (https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12538). The `isNonTrivialRegular` function in `ExprDefEq` was classifying class projections as nontrivial at all transparency levels, but the extra `.instances` reduction in `unfoldDefault` that motivates this classification only applies at `.reducible` transparency. At higher transparency levels, the nontrivial classification caused unnecessary heuristic comparison attempts in `isDefEqDelta` that cascaded through BitVec reductions, causing elaboration of `Lean.Data.Json.Parser` to double from ~3.6G to ~7.2G instructions.

  * [#11811](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11811) proves that membership is preserved by eraseDups: an element exists in the deduplicated list iff it was in the original.
  * [#11832](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11832) uses an `Array` instead of a `List` to store the clauses in `Std.CNF`. This reduces the memory footprint and pressure on the allocator, leading to noticeable performance changes with gigantic CNFs.
  * [#11936](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11936) provides `Array` operations analogous to `List.min(?)` and `List.max(?)`.
  * [#11938](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11938) introduces projected minima and maxima, also known as "argmin/argmax", for lists under the names `List.minOn` and `List.maxOn`. It also introduces `List.minIdxOn` and `List.maxIdxOn`, which return the index of the minimal or maximal element. Moreover, there are variants with `?` suffix that return an `Option`. The change further introduces new instances for opposite orders, such as `LE.opposite`, `IsLinearOrder.opposite` etc. The change also adds the missing `Std.lt_irrefl` lemma.
  * [#11943](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11943) introduces the theorem `BitVec.sshiftRight_eq_setWidth_extractLsb_signExtend` theorem, proving `x.sshiftRight n` is equivalent to first sign-extending `x`, extracting the appropriate least significant bits, and then setting the width back to `w`.
  * [#11994](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11994) provides more lemmas about sums of lists/arrays/vectors, especially sums of `Nat` or `Int` lists/arrays/vectors.
  * [#12017](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12017) makes several small improvements to the list/array/vector API:
    * It fixes typos in `Init.Core`.
    * It adds `List.isSome_min_iff` and `List.isSome_max_iff`.
    * It adds `grind` and `simp` annotations to various previously unannotated lemmas.
    * It adds lemmas for characterizing `∃ x ∈ xs, P x` using indices as `∃   (i : Nat), ∃ hi, P (xs[i])`, and similar universally quantified lemmas: `exists_mem_iff_exists_getElem` and `forall_mem_iff_forall_getElem`.
    * It adds `Vector.toList_zip`.
    * It adds `map_ofFn` and `ofFn_getElem` for lists/arrays/vectors.
  * [#12019](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12019) provides the `Nat`/`Int` lemmas `x ≤ y * z ↔ (x + z - 1) / z ≤   y`, `x ≤ y * z ↔ (x + y - 1) / y ≤ z` and `x / z + y / z ≤ (x + y) / z`.
  * [#12108](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12108) adds `prefix_map_iff_of_injective` and `suffix_map_iff_of_injective` lemmas to Init.Data.List.Nat.Sublist.
  * [#12161](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12161) adds `Option.of_wp_eq` and `Except.of_wp_eq`, similar to the existing `Except.of_wp`. `Except.of_wp` is deprecated because applying it requires prior generalization, at which point it is more convenient to use `Except.of_wp_eq`.
  * [#12162](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12162) adds the function `Std.Iter.first?` and proves the specification lemma `Std.Iter.first?_eq_match_step` if the iterator is productive.
  * [#12170](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12170) adjusts the grind annotations for List.take/drop, and adds two theorems.
  * [#12181](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12181) adds two missing order instances for `Int`.
  * [#12193](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12193) adds `DecidableEq` instances for `Sigma` and `PSigma`.
  * [#12204](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12204) adds theorems showing the consistency between `find?` and the various index-finding functions. The theorems establish bidirectional relationships between finding elements and finding their indices.
  * [#12212](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12212) adds the function `Std.Iter.isEmpty` and proves the specification lemmas `Std.Iter.isEmpty_eq_match_step` and `Std.Iter.isEmpty_toList` if the iterator is productive.
  * [#12220](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12220) fixes a bug on Windows with `IO.Process.spawn` where setting an environment variable to the empty string would not set the environment variable on the subprocess.
  * [#12234](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12234) introduces an `Iter.step_eq` lemma that fully unfolds an `Iter.step` call, bypassing layers of unfolding.
  * [#12249](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12249) adds some lemmas about the interaction of `sum`, `min` and `max` about arrays that already exist for lists.
  * [#12250](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12250) introduces the defining equality `Triple.iff` and uses that in proofs instead of relying on definitional equality. It also introduces `Triple.iff_conseq` that is useful for backward reasoning and introduces verification conditions. Similarly, `Triple.entails_wp_*` theorems are introduced for backward reasoning where the target is an stateful entailment rather than a triple.
  * [#12258](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12258) adds theorems that directly state that div and mod form an injective pair: if `a / n = b / n` and `a % n = b % n` then `a = b`. These complement existing div/mod lemmas and are useful for extension arguments.
  * [#12277](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12277) adds `IO.FS.Metadata.numLinks`, which contains the number of hard links to a file.
  * [#12281](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12281) changes the definition of `Squash` to use `Quotient` by upstreaming [`true_equivalence`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Quot.html#true_equivalence) (now `equivalence_true`) and [`trueSetoid`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Quot.html#trueSetoid) (now `Setoid.trivial`). The new definition is def-eq to the old one, but ensures that `Squash` can be used whenever a `Quotient` argument is expected without having to explicitly provide the setoid.
  * [#12282](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12282) fixes a platform inconsistency in `IO.FS.removeFile` where it could not delete read-only files on Windows.
  * [#12290](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12290) moves the `PredTrans.apply` structure field into a separate `def`. Doing so improves kernel reduction speed because the kernel is less likely to unfold definitions compared to structure field projections. This causes minor shifts in `simp` normal forms.
  * [#12301](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12301) introduces the functions `(String|Slice).posGE` and `(String|Slice).posGT` will full verification and deprecates `Slice.findNextPos` in favor of `Slice.posGT`.
  * [#12305](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12305) adds various uninteresting lemmas about basic types, extracted from the KMP verification.
  * [#12311](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12311) exposes the chain and `is_sup` definitions such that other modules can declare custom CCPO instances.
  * [#12312](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12312) reverses the relationship between the `ForwardPattern` and `ToForwardSearcher` classes.
  * [#12318](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12318) avoids undefined behavior in `String.Slice.hash` on unaligned substrings. This could produce a SIGILL on some Arm platforms.
  * [#12322](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12322) adds `String.Slice.Subslice`, which is an unbundled version of `String.Slice`.
  * [#12333](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12333) adds the basic typeclasses that will be used in the verification of our string searching infrastructure.
  * [#12341](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12341) adds a few unification hints that we will need after `backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency` is `true` by default.
  * [#12346](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12346) shows `s == t ↔ s.copy = t.copy` for `s t : String.Slice` and establishes the right-hand side as the simp normal form.
  * [#12349](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12349) builds on #12333 and proves that `Char` and `Char -> Bool` patterns are lawful.
  * [#12352](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12352) improves the slice API with lemmas for `drop`/`take` operations on `Subarray` and more lemmas about `Std.Slice.fold`, `Std.Slice.foldM` and `Std.Slice.forIn`. It also changes the `simp` and `grind` annotations for `Slice`-related lemmas. Lemmas converting between slices of different shapes are no longer `simp`/`grind`-annotated because they often complicated lemmas and hindered automation.
  * [#12358](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12358) improves the `simp` and `grind` rule framework for `PredTrans.apply` and also renames the respective lemmas according to convention.
  * [#12359](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12359) deprecates `extract_eq_drop_take` in favor of the more correct name `extract_eq_take_drop`, so that we'll be able to use the old name for a lemma `xs.extract start stop = (xs.take stop).drop start`. Until the deprecation deadline has passed, this new lemma will be called `extract_eq_drop_take'`.
  * [#12360](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12360) provides a `LawfulForwardPatternModel` instance for string patterns, i.e., it proves correctness of the `dropPrefix?` and `startsWith` functions for string patterns.
  * [#12363](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12363) introduces iterators for vectors via `Vector.iter` and `Vector.iterM`, together with the usual lemmas.
  * [#12371](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12371) adds lemmas for simplifying situations involving `Bool` and `ite`/`dite`.
  * [#12412](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12412) introduces `Rat.abs` and adds missing lemmas about `Int` and `Rat`.
  * [#12419](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12419) adds `LawfulOrderOrd` instances for `Nat`, `Int`, and all fixed-width integer types (`Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `ISize`, `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, `UInt64`, `USize`). These instances establish that the `Ord` instances for these types are compatible with their `LE` instances. Additionally, this PR adds a few missing lemmas and `grind` patterns.
  * [#12424](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12424) gives a proof of `LawfulToForwardSearcherModel` for `Slice` patterns, which amounts to proving that our implementation of KMP is correct.
  * [#12426](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12426) adds the lemma `Acc.inv_of_transGen`, a generalization of `Acc.inv`. While `Acc.inv` shows that `Acc r x` implies `Acc r y` given that `r y x`, the new lemma shows that this also holds if `y` is only **transitively** related to `x`.
  * [#12432](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12432) adds the lemmas `isSome_find?` and `isSome_findSome?` to the API of lists, arrays and vectors.
  * [#12437](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12437) verifies the `String.Slice.splitToSubslice` function by relating it to a model implementation `Model.split` based on a `ForwardPatternModel`.
  * [#12438](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12438) provides (1) lemmas showing that lists obtained from ranges have no duplicates and (2) lemmas about `forIn` and `foldl` on slices.
  * [#12441](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12441) removes `Subarray.foldl(M)`, `Subarray.toArray` and `Subarray.size` in favor of the `Std.Slice`-namespaced operations. Dot notation will continue to work. If, say, `Subarray.size` is explicitly referred to, an error suggesting to use `Std.Slice.size` will show up.
  * [#12442](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12442) derives `DecidableEq` instances for the types of ranges such as `a...b` (in this case, `Std.Rco`).
  * [#12445](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12445) provides lemmas characterizing `Nat.toDigits`, `Nat.repr` and `ToString Nat`.
  * [#12449](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12449) marks `String.toString_eq_singleton` as a `simp` lemma.
  * [#12450](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12450) moves the `String.Slice`/`String` iterators out into their own file, in preparation for verification.
  * [#12452](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12452) upstreams `List.scanl`, `List.scanr` and their lemmas from batteries into the standard library.
  * [#12456](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12456) verifies all of the `String` iterators except for the bytes iterator by relating them to `String.toList`.
  * [#12504](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12504) makes the `Rat.abs_*` lemmas (`abs_zero`, `abs_nonneg`, `abs_of_nonneg`, `abs_of_nonpos`, `abs_neg`, `abs_sub_comm`, `abs_eq_zero_iff`, `abs_pos_iff`) protected, so they don't shadow the general `abs_*` lemmas when the `Rat` namespace is opened in downstream projects.
  * [#12521](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12521) shows `HashSet.ofList l ~m l.foldl (init := ∅) fun acc a =>   acc.insert a` (which is "just" the definition).
  * [#12531](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12531) bundles some lemmas about hash maps into equivalences for easier rewriting.
  * [#12582](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12582) uses a `ptrEq` fast path for `Name.quickCmp`. It is particularly effective at speeding up `quickCmp` calls in `TreeMap`'s indexed by `FVarId` as usually there is only one pointer per `FVarId` so equality is always instantly detected without traversing the linked list of `Name` components.
  * [#12583](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12583) inlines the accessor for the computed hash field of `Name`. This ensures that accessing the value is basically always just a single load instead of doing a full function call.
  * [#12596](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12596) adds an `Std.Do` spec lemma for `ForIn` over strings.
  * [#12641](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12641) derives the linear order on string positions (`String.Pos.Raw`, `String.Pos`, `String.Slice.Pos`) via `Std.LinearOrderPackage`, which ensures that all data-carrying and propositional instances are present.
  * [#12642](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12642) adds dsimprocs for reducing `String.toList` and `String.push`.
  * [#12651](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12651) adds some missing lemmas about `min`, `minOn`, `List.min`, `List.minOn`.


##  Tactics[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___29___0-rc6-_LPAR_2026-02-24_RPAR_--Tactics "Permalink")
  * [#11744](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11744) fixes a bug where `lia` was incorrectly solving goals involving ordered types like `Rat` that it shouldn't handle. The `lia` tactic is intended for linear integer arithmetic only.
  * [#12152](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12152) adds `simpArrowTelescope`, a simproc that simplifies telescopes of non-dependent arrows (p₁ → p₂ → ... → q) while avoiding quadratic proof growth.
  * [#12153](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12153) improves the `simpArrowTelescope` simproc that simplifies non-dependent arrow telescopes: `p₁ → p₂ → ... → q`.
  * [#12154](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12154) adds `simpTelescope`, a simproc that simplifies telescope binders (`have`-expression values and arrow hypotheses) but not the final body. This is useful for simplifying targets before introducing hypotheses.
  * [#12168](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12168) adds support for eta-reduction in `SymM`.
  * [#12172](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12172) fixes how we determine whether a function parameter is an instance. Previously, we relied on binder annotations (e.g., `[Ring A]` vs `{_ :   Ring A}`) to make this determination. This is unreliable because users legitimately use `{..}` binders for class types when the instance is already available from context. For example:

```
structure OrdSet (α : Type) [Hashable α] [BEq α] where
  ...

def OrdSet.insert {_ : Hashable α} {_ : BEq α} (s : OrdSet α) (a : α) : OrdSet α :=
  ...

```

Here, `Hashable` and `BEq` are classes, but the `{..}` binder is intentional, the instances come from `OrdSet`'s parameters, so type class resolution is unnecessary.
The fix checks the parameter's **type** using `isClass?` rather than its syntax, and caches this information in `FunInfo`. This affects several subsystems: discrimination trees, congruence lemma generation, and the `grind` canonicalizer.
  * [#12176](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12176) fixes a bug where delayed E-match theorem instances could cause uniqueId collisions in the instance tracking map.
  * [#12195](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12195) ensures `dsimp` does not "simplify" instances by default. The old behavior can be retrieved by using

```
set_option backward.dsimp.instances true

```

Applying `dsimp` to instances creates non-standard instances, and this creates all sorts of problems in Mathlib. This modification is similar to

```
set_option backward.dsimp.proofs true

```

  * [#12205](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12205) adds `mkBackwardRuleFromExpr` to create backward rules from expressions, complementing the existing `mkBackwardRuleFromDecl` which only works with declaration names.
  * [#12224](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12224) fixes a bug where `grind?` suggestions would not include parameters using local variable dot notation (e.g., `cs.getD_rightInvSeq` where `cs` is a local variable). These parameters were incorrectly filtered out because the code assumed all ident params resolve to global declarations. In fact, local variable dot notation produces anchors that need the original term to be loaded during replay, so they must be preserved in the suggestion.
  * [#12226](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12226) fixes a bug where `grind [foo]` fails when the theorem `foo` has a different universe variable name than the goal, even though universe polymorphism should allow the universes to unify.
  * [#12244](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12244) ensures `simp` does not "simplify" instances by default. The old behavior can be retrieved by using `simp +instances`. is similar to #12195, but for `dsimp`. The backward compatibility flag for `dsimp` also deactivates this new feature.
  * [#12259](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12259) ensures we cache the result of `unfold_definition` definition in the kernel type checker. We used to cache this information in a thread local storage, but it was deleted during the Lean 3 to Lean 4 transition.
  * [#12260](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12260) fixes a bug in the function `instantiateRangeS'` in the `Sym` framework.
  * [#12279](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12279) adds an experimental `cbv` tactic that can be invoked from `conv` mode. The tactic is not suitable for production use and an appropriate warning is displayed.
  * [#12280](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12280) adds a benchmark based on Xavier Leroy's compiler verification course to test call-by-value tactic.
  * [#12287](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12287) fixes an issue where `attribute [local simp]` was incorrectly rejected on a theorem from a private import
  * [#12296](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12296) adds `cbv_eval` attribute that allows to evaluate functions in `cbv` tactic using pre-registered theorems.
  * [#12319](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12319) leverages the fact that expressions are type correct in `grind` and the conclusion of extensionality theorems is of the form `?a = ?b`.
  * [#12345](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12345) adds two benchmarks (sieve of Eratosthenes, removing duplicates from the list) and one test (a function with sublinear complexity defined via well-founded recursion evaluated on large naturals with up to `60` digits).
  * [#12361](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12361) develops custom simprocs for dealing with `ite`/`dite` expressions in `cbv` tactics, based on equivalent simprocs from `Sym.simp`, with the difference that if the condition is not reduced to `True`/`False`, we make use of the decidable instance and calculate to what the condition reduces to.
  * [#12370](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12370) fixes a proof construction bug in `Sym.simp`.
  * [#12399](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12399) adds a custom simproc to handle `Decidable.rec`, where we force the rewrite in the argument of the `Decidable` type, that normally is not rewritten due to being a subsingleton.
  * [#12406](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12406) implements two changes to LRAT checking in `bv_decide`:
    1. The LRAT trimmer previously used to drop delete instructions as we did not act upon them in a meaningful way (as explained in 2). Now it figures out the earliest point after which a clause may be deleted in the trimmed LRAT proof and inserts a deletion there.
    2. The LRAT checker takes in an `Array IntAction` and explodes it into an `Array DefaultClauseAction` before passing it into the checking loop. `DefaultClauseAction` has a much larger memory footprint compared to `IntAction`. Thus materializing the entire proof as `DefaultClauseAction` upfront consumes a lot of memory. In the adapted LRAT checker we take in an `Array IntAction` and only ever convert the step we are currently working on to a `DefaultClauseAction`. In combination with the fact that we now insert deletion instructions this can drastically reduce memory consumption.
  * [#12408](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12408) adds a user facing `cbv` tactic that can be used outside of the `conv` mode.
  * [#12411](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12411) adds a finishing `decide_cbv` tactic, which applies `of_decide_eq_true` and then tries to discharge the remaining goal using `cbv`.
  * [#12415](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12415) improves the support for eta expanded terms in `grind` patterns.
  * [#12417](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12417) refactors the main loop of the `cbv` tactic. Rather than using multiple simprocs, a central pre simproc is introduced. Moreover, let expressions are no longer immediately zeta-reduced due to performance on one of the benchmarks (`leroy.lean`).
  * [#12423](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12423) adds the attribute `@[univ_out_params]` for specifying which universe levels should be treated as output parameters. By default, any universe level that does not occur in any input parameter is considered an output parameter.
  * [#12467](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12467) adds a benchmark for `cbv` tactic for evaluating `Decidable.decide` for a `Decidable` instance for a problem of checking if a number is not a prime power.
  * [#12473](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12473) fixes an assertion violation in `grind` reported at #12246 This assertion fails when in examples containing heterogenous equalities with elements of different types (e.g., `Fin n` and `Fin m`) attached to the same theory solver.
  * [#12474](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12474) fixes a panic in `grind` where `sreifyCore?` could encounter power subterms not yet internalized in the E-graph during nested propagation. The ring reifier (`reifyCore?`) already had a defensive `alreadyInternalized` check before creating variables, but the semiring reifier (`sreifyCore?`) was missing this guard. When `propagatePower` decomposed `a ^ (b₁ + b₂)` into `a^b₁ * a^b₂` and the resulting terms triggered further propagation, the semiring reifier could be called on subterms not yet in the E-graph, causing `markTerm` to fail.
  * [#12475](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12475) fixes `grind` failing when hypotheses contain metavariables (e.g., after `refine`). The root cause was that `abstractMVars` in `withProtectedMCtx` only abstracted metavariables in the target, not in hypotheses, creating a disconnect in grind's e-graph.
  * [#12476](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12476) fixes #12245 where `grind` works on `Fin n` but fails on `Fin (n   + 1)`.
  * [#12477](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12477) fixes an internal `grind` error where `mkEqProof` is invoked with terms of different types. When equivalence classes contain heterogeneous equalities (e.g., `0 : Fin 3` and `0 : Fin 2` merged via `HEq`), `closeGoalWithValuesEq` would call `mkEqProof` on terms with incompatible types, triggering an internal error.
  * [#12480](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12480) skips the relabeling step during AIG to CNF conversion, reducing memory pressure.
  * [#12483](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12483) adds support for higher-order Miller patterns in `grind`'s e-matching engine.
  * [#12486](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12486) caches `isDefEqI` results in `Sym`. During symbolic computation (e.g., VC generators), we find the same instances over and over again.
  * [#12500](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12500) improves the error messages produced by the `decide_cbv` tactic by only reducing the left-hand side of the equality introduced by `of_decide_eq_true`, rather than attempting to reduce both sides via `cbvGoal`.
  * [#12506](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12506) adds the ability to register theorems with the `cbv_eval` attribute in the reverse direction using the `←` modifier, mirroring the existing `simp` attribute behavior. When `@[cbv_eval ←]` is used, the equation `lhs = rhs` is inverted to `rhs = lhs`, allowing `cbv` to rewrite occurrences of `rhs` to `lhs`.
  * [#12562](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12562) fixes #12554 where the `cbv` tactic throws "unexpected kernel projection term during structural definitional equality" when a rewrite theorem's pattern contains a lambda and the expression being matched has a `.proj` (kernel projection) at the corresponding position.
  * [#12568](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12568) removes `tryMatchEquations` and `tryMatcher` from `Lean.Meta.Tactic.Cbv.Main`, as both are already defined and used in `Lean.Meta.Tactic.Cbv.ControlFlow`. The copies in `Main.lean` were unreachable dead code.
  * [#12585](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12585) removes unnecessary `trySynthInstance ` in `ite` and `dite` simprocs used by `cbv` that previously contributed to too much of unnecessary unrolling by the tactic.
  * [#12588](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12588) adds a benchmark for `cbv` tactic that involves evaluating `List.mergeSort` on a reversed list on natural numbers.
  * [#12601](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12601) adds a warning when using `cbv` or `decide_cbv` in tactic mode, matching the existing warning in conv mode (`src/Lean/Elab/Tactic/Conv/Cbv.lean`). The warning informs users that these tactics are experimental and still under development. It can be disabled with `set_option cbv.warning false`.
  * [#12612](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12612) fixes a crash in the `cbv` tactic's `handleProj` simproc when processing a dependent projection (e.g. `Sigma.snd`) whose struct is rewritten via `@[cbv_eval]` to a non-definitionally-equal term that cannot be further reduced.
  * [#12615](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12615) fixes a flipped condition in `handleConst` that prevented `cbv` from unfolding nullary (non-function) constant definitions like `def myVal : Nat := 42`. The check `unless eType matches .forallE` was intended to skip bare function constants (whose unfold theorems expect arguments) but instead skipped value constants. The fix changes the guard to `if eType matches .forallE`, matching the logic used in the standard `simp` ground evaluator.
  * [#12622](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12622) fixes a bug where `simp` made no progress on class projection reductions when `backward.whnf.reducibleClassField` is `true`.
  * [#12627](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12627) reverts #12615, which accidentally broke Leroy's compiler verification course benchmark.
  * [#12646](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12646) enables the `cbv` tactic to unfold nullary (non-function) constant definitions such as `def myNat : Nat := 42`, allowing ground term evaluation (e.g. `evalEq`, `evalLT`) to recognize their values as literals.


##  Compiler[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___29___0-rc6-_LPAR_2026-02-24_RPAR_--Compiler "Permalink")
  * [#12044](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12044) implements lazy initialization of closed terms. Previous work has already made sure that ~70% of the closed terms occurring in core can be statically initialized from the binary. With this the remaining ones are initialized lazily instead of at startup.
  * [#12052](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12052) avoids a potential deadlock on shutdown of a Lean program when the number of pooled threads has temporarily been pushed above the limit.
  * [#12060](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12060) strips unneeded symbol names from libleanshared.so on Linux. It appears that on other platforms the symbols names we are interested in here are already removed by the linker.
  * [#12082](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12082) makes the compiler produce C code that statically initializes close terms when possible. This change reduces startup time as the terms are directly stored in the binary instead of getting computed at startup.
  * [#12117](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12117) upgrades Lean's internal toolchain to use C++20 as a preparatory step for #12044.
  * [#12214](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12214) introduces a phase separation to the LCNF IR. This is a preparation for the merge of the old `Lean.Compiler.IR` and the new `Lean.Compiler.LCNF` framework.
  * [#12239](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12239) reverts a lot of the changes done in #8308. We practically encountered situations such as:

```
fun y (z) :=
  let x := inst
  mkInst x z
f y

```

Where the instance puller turns it into:

```
let x := inst
fun y (z) :=
  mkInst x z
f y

```

The current heuristic now discovers `x` being in scope at the call site of `f` and being used under a binder in `y` and thus blocks pulling in `x` to the specialization, abstracting over an instance.
  * [#12272](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12272) shifts the conversion from LCNF mono to lambda pure into the LCNF impure phase. This is preparatory work for the upcoming refactor of IR into LCNF impure.
  * [#12284](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12284) changes the handling of over-applied cases expressions in `ToLCNF` to avoid generating function declarations that are called immediately. For example, `ToLCNF` previously produced this:

```
set_option trace.Compiler.init true
/--
trace: [Compiler.init] size: 4
    def test x y : Bool :=
      fun _y.1 _y.2 : Bool :=
        cases x : Bool
        | PUnit.unit =>
          fun _f.3 a : Bool :=
            return a;
          let _x.4 := _f.3 _y.2;
          return _x.4;
      let _x.5 := _y.1 y;
      return _x.5
-/
#guard_msgs in
def test (x : Unit) (y : Bool) : Bool :=
  x.casesOn (fun a => a) y

```

which is now simplified to

```
set_option trace.Compiler.init true
/--
trace: [Compiler.init] size: 3
    def test x y : Bool :=
      cases x : Bool
      | PUnit.unit =>
        let a := y;
        return a
-/
#guard_msgs in
def test (x : Unit) (y : Bool) : Bool :=
  x.casesOn (fun a => a) y

```

This is especially relevant for #8309 because there `dite` is defined as an over-applied `Bool.casesOn`.
  * [#12294](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12294) ports the `push_proj` pass from IR to LCNF. Notably it cannot delete it from IR yet as the pass is still used later on.
  * [#12315](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12315) migrates the IR ResetReuse pass to LCNF.
  * [#12344](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12344) changes the semantics of `inline` annotations in the compiler. The behavior of the original `@[inline]` attribute remains the same but the function `inline` now comes with a restriction that it can only use declarations that are local to the current module. This comes as a preparation to pulling the compiler out into a separate process.
  * [#12356](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12356) moves the IR `elim_dead_vars` pass to LCNF. It cannot delete the pass yet as it is still used in later IR passes.
  * [#12384](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12384) ports the IR SimpCase pass to LCNF.
  * [#12387](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12387) fixes an issue in LCNF simp where it would attempt to act on type incorrect `cases` statements and look for a branch, otherwise panic. This issue did not yet manifest in production as various other invariants upheld by LCNF simp help mask it but will start to become an issue with the upcoming changes.
  * [#12413](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12413) ports the IR borrow pass to LCNF.
  * [#12434](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12434) removes the uses of `shared_timed_mutex` that were introduced because we were stuck on C++14 with the `shared_mutex` available from C++17 and above.
  * [#12446](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12446) adds a simplification rule for `Task.get (Task.pure x) = x` into the LCNF simplifier. This ensures that we avoid touching the runtime for a `Task` that instantly gets destructed anyways.
  * [#12458](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12458) ports the IR pass for box/unbox insertion to LCNF.
  * [#12465](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12465) changes the boxed type of `uint64` from `tobject` to `object` to allow for more precise reference counting.
  * [#12466](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12466) handles zero-sized reads on handles correctly by returning an empty array before the syscall is even attempted.
  * [#12472](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12472) inlines `mix_hash` from C++ which provides general speedups for hash functions.
  * [#12548](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12548) ports the RC insertion from IR to LCNF.
  * [#12580](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12580) makes `computed_field` respect the inline attributes on the function for computing the field. This means we can inline the accessor for the field, allowing quicker access.
  * [#12604](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12604) makes the derived value analysis in RC insertion recognize `Array.uget` as another kind of "projection-like" operation. This allows it to reduce reference count pressure on elements accessed through uget.
  * [#12625](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12625) ensures that failure in initial compilation marks the relevant definitions as `noncomputable`, inside and outside `noncomputable   section`, so that follow-up errors/noncomputable markings are detected in initial compilation as well instead of somewhere down the pipeline.
  * [#12644](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12644) ports the toposorting pass from IR to LCNF.

  * [#12174](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12174) fixes a typo in `ExtractLetsConfig.merge` doc comment.
  * [#12253](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12253) adds a "Stabilizing output" section to the `#guard_msgs` docstring, explaining how to use `pp.mvars.anonymous` and `pp.mvars` options to stabilize output containing autogenerated metavariable names like `?m.47`.
  * [#12271](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12271) adds and updates docstrings for syntax (and one for ranges).
  * [#12439](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12439) improves docstrings for `cbv` and `decide_cbv` tactics
  * [#12487](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12487) expands the docstring for `@[univ_out_params]` to explain:
    * How universe output parameters affect the typeclass resolution cache (they are erased from cache keys, so queries differing only in output universes share entries)
    * When a universe parameter should be considered an output (determined by inputs) vs. not (part of the question being asked)
  * [#12616](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12616) adds documentation to the Cbv evaluator files under `Meta/Tactic/Cbv/`. Module docstrings describe the evaluation strategy, limitations, attributes, and unfolding order. Function docstrings cover the public API and key internal simprocs.


##  Server[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___29___0-rc6-_LPAR_2026-02-24_RPAR_--Server "Permalink")
  * [#12197](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12197) fixes a bug in `System.Uri.fileUriToPath?` where it wouldn't use the default Windows path separator in the path it produces.
  * [#12332](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12332) fixes an issue on new NeoVim versions that would cause the language server to display an error when using certain code actions.
  * [#12553](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12553) fixes an issue where commands that do not support incrementality did not have their elaboration interrupted when a relevant edit is made by the user. As all built-in variants of def/theorem share a common incremental elaborator, this likely had negligible impact on standard Lean files but could affect other use cases heavily relying on custom commands such as Verso.


##  Lake[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___29___0-rc6-_LPAR_2026-02-24_RPAR_--Lake "Permalink")
  * [#12113](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12113) changes the alters the file format of outputs stored in the local Lake cache to include an identifier indicating the service (if any) the output came from. This will be used to enable lazily downloading artifacts on-demand during builds.
  * [#12178](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12178) scopes the `simp` attribute on `FamilyOut.fam_eq` to the `Lake` namespace. The lemma has a very permissive discrimination tree key (`_`), so when `Lake.Util.Family` is transitively imported into downstream projects, it causes `simp` to attempt this lemma on every goal, leading to timeouts.
  * [#12203](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12203) changes the way artifacts are transferred from the local Lake cache to a local build path. Now, Lake will first attempt to hard link the local build path to artifact in the cache. If this fails (e.g., because the cache is on a different file system or drive), it will fallback to pre-existing approach of copying the artifact. Lake also now marks cache artifacts as read-only to avoid corrupting the cache by writing to a hard linked artifact.
  * [#12261](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12261) fixes a bug in Lake where the facet names printed in unknown facet errors would contain the internal facet kind.
  * [#12300](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12300) makes disabling the artifact cache (e.g., via `LAKE_ARTIFACT_CACHE=false` or `enableArtifactCache = false`) now stop Lake from fetching from the cache (whereas it previously only stopped writing to it).
  * [#12377](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12377) adds identifying information about a module available to `lean` (e.g., its name and package identifier) to the module's dependency trace. This ensures modules with different identification have different input hashes even if their source files and imports are identical.
  * [#12444](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12444) adds the Lake CLI command `lake cache clean`, which deletes the Lake cache directory.
  * [#12461](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12461) adds support for manually re-releasing nightlies when a build issue or critical fix requires it. When a `workflow_dispatch` triggers the nightly release job and a `nightly-YYYY-MM-DD` tag already exists, the CI now creates `nightly-YYYY-MM-DD-rev1` (then `-rev2`, etc.) instead of silently skipping.
  * [#12490](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12490) adds a system-wide Lake configuration file and uses it to configure the remote cache services used by `lake cache`.
  * [#12532](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12532) fixes a bug with `cache clean` where it would fail if the cache directory does not exist.
  * [#12537](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12537) fixes a bug where Lake recached artifacts already present within the cache. As a result, Lake would attempt to overwrite the read-only artifacts, causing a permission denied error.


##  Other[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___29___0-rc6-_LPAR_2026-02-24_RPAR_--Other "Permalink")
  * [#12351](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12351) extends the `@[csimp]` attribute to be correctly tracked by `lake shake`
  * [#12375](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12375) extends shake with tracking of attribute names passed to `simp`/`grind`.
  * [#12463](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12463) fixes two issues discovered during the first test of the revised nightly release workflow (https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12461):
**1. Date logic:** The `workflow_dispatch` path used `date -u +%F` (current UTC date) to find the base nightly to revise. If the most recent nightly was from yesterday (e.g. `nightly-2026-02-12`) but UTC has rolled over to Feb 13, the code would look for `nightly-2026-02-13`, not find it, and create a fresh nightly instead of a revision. Now finds the latest `nightly-*` tag via `sort -rV` and creates a revision of that.
  * [#12517](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12517) adds tooling for profiling Lean programs with human-readable function names in Firefox Profiler:
    * **`script/lean_profile.sh`**— One-command pipeline: record with samply, symbolicate, demangle, and open in Firefox Profiler
    * **`script/profiler/lean_demangle.py`**— Faithful port of`Name.demangleAux` from `NameMangling.lean`, with a postprocessor that folds compiler suffixes into compact annotations (`[λ, arity↓]`, `spec   at context[flags]`)
    * **`script/profiler/symbolicate_profile.py`**— Resolves raw addresses via samply's symbolication API
    * **`script/profiler/serve_profile.py`**— Serves demangled profiles to Firefox Profiler without re-symbolication
    * **`PROFILER_README.md`**— Documentation including a guide to reading demangled names
  * [#12533](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12533) adds human-friendly demangling of Lean symbol names in runtime backtraces. When a Lean program panics, stack traces now show readable names instead of mangled C identifiers.
