##  Highlights[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Highlights "Permalink")
Lean 4.24.0 release brings continued improvements to the module system and the verification framework, strengthens the `grind` tactic, and advances the standard library. The release also introduces more efficient constructions of `DecidableEq` instances and `noConfusion` ([#10152](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10152) and [#10300](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10300)), optimizing compilation.
As an example for our continuous improvements to performance:
  * [#10249](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10249) speeds up auto-completion by a factor of ~3.5x through various performance improvements in the language server.


As always, there are plenty of bug fixes and new features, some of which are listed below:
###  "Try this" suggestions are rendered under 'Messages'[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Highlights--___Try-this___-suggestions-are-rendered-under-___Messages___ "Permalink")
  * [#9966](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9966) adjusts the "try this" widget to be rendered as a widget message under 'Messages', not a separate widget under a 'Suggestions' section. The main benefit of this is that the message of the widget is not duplicated between 'Messages' and 'Suggestions'.


###  `invariants` and `with` sections in `mvcgen`[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Highlights--invariants-and-with-sections-in-mvcgen "Permalink")
  * [#9927](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9927) implements extended `induction`-inspired syntax for `mvcgen`, allowing optional `invariants` and `with` sections.
The example below gives the proof that `nodup` correctly checks for duplicates in a list.

```
import Std.Tactic.Do
import Std

open Std Do

def nodup (l : List Int) : Bool := Id.run do
  let mut seen : HashSet Int := ∅
  for x in l do
    if x ∈ seen then
      return false
    seen := seen.insert x
  return true

theorem nodup_correct (h : nodup l = r) : r = true ↔ l.Nodup := by
  unfold nodup at h
  apply Id.of_wp_run_eq h; clear h
  mvcgen
  invariants
  · Invariant.withEarlyReturn
      (onReturn := fun ret seen => ⌜ret = false ∧ ¬l.Nodup⌝)
      (onContinue := fun xs seen =>
        ⌜(∀ x, x ∈ seen ↔ x ∈ xs.prefix) ∧ xs.prefix.Nodup⌝)
  with grind

```



###  Library: Dyadic rationals[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Highlights--Library___-Dyadic-rationals "Permalink")
  * [#9993](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9993) defines the dyadic rationals, showing they are an ordered ring embedding into the rationals.


###  Grind AC solver[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Highlights--Grind-AC-solver "Permalink")
`grind` can reason about associative, commutative, idempotent, and/or unital operations ([#10105](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10105), [#10146](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10146), etc..):

```
example (a b c : Nat) : max a (max b c) = max (max b 0) (max a c) := by
  grind only

example {α} (as bs cs : List α) : as ++ (bs ++ cs) = ((as ++ []) ++ bs) ++ (cs ++ []) := by
  grind only

example {α : Sort u} (op : α → α → α) (u : α) [Std.Associative op] [Std.Commutative op] [Std.IdempotentOp op] [Std.LawfulIdentity op u] (a b c : α)
    : op (op a a) (op b c) = op (op (op b a) (op (op u b) b)) c := by
  grind only

```

###  Metaprogramming notes[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Highlights--Metaprogramming-notes "Permalink")
  * [#10306](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10306) fixes a few bugs in the `rw` tactic.
Metaprogramming API: Instead of `Lean.MVarId.rewrite` prefer `Lean.Elab.Tactic.elabRewrite` for elaborating rewrite theorems and applying rewrites to expressions.


###  Breaking changes[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Highlights--Breaking-changes "Permalink")
  * [#9749](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9749) refactors the Lake codebase to use the new module system throughout. Every module in `Lake` is now a `module`.
**Breaking change:** Since the module system encourages a `private`-by-default design, the Lake API has switched from its previous `public`-by-default approach. As such, many definitions that were previously public are now private. The newly private definitions are not expected to have had significant user use, nonetheless, important use cases could be missed. If a key API is now inaccessible but seems like it should be public, users are encouraged to report this as an issue on GitHub.


##  Language[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Language "Permalink")
  * [#8891](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8891) improves the error message produced when passing (automatically redundant) local hypotheses to `grind`.
  * [#9651](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9651) modifies the generation of induction and partial correctness lemmas for `mutual` blocks defined via `partial_fixpoint`. Additionally, the generation of lattice-theoretic induction principles of functions via `mutual` blocks is modified for consistency with `partial_fixpoint`.
  * [#9674](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9674) cleans up `optParam`/`autoParam`/etc. annotations before elaborating definition bodies, theorem bodies, `fun` bodies, and `let` function bodies. Both `variable`s and binders in declaration headers are supported.
  * [#9918](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9918) prevents `rcases` and `obtain` from creating absurdly long case tag names when taking single constructor types (like `Exists`) apart. Fixes #6550
  * [#9923](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9923) adds a guard for a delaborator that is causing panics in doc-gen4. This is a band-aid solution for now, and @sgraf812 will take a look when they're back from leave.
  * [#9926](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9926) guards the `Std.Tactic.Do.MGoalEntails` delaborator by a check ensuring that there are at least 3 arguments present, preventing potential panics.
  * [#9927](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9927) implements extended `induction`-inspired syntax for `mvcgen`, allowing optional `using invariants` and `with` sections.
  * [#9930](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9930) reverts the way `grind cutsat` embeds `Nat.sub` into `Int`. It fixes a regression reported by David Renshaw on Zulip.
  * [#9938](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9938) removes a duplicate `mpure_intro` tactic definition.
  * [#9939](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9939) expands `mvcgen using invariants | $n => $t` to `mvcgen; case inv<$n> => exact $t` to avoid MVar instantiation mishaps observable in the test case for #9581.
  * [#9942](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9942) modifies `intro` to create tactic info localized to each hypothesis, making it possible to see how `intro` works variable-by-variable. Additionally:
    * The tactic supports `intro rfl` to introduce an equality and immediately substitute it, like `rintro rfl` (recall: the `rfl` pattern is like doing `intro h; subst h`). The `rintro` tactic can also now support `HEq` in `rfl` patterns if `eq_of_heq` applies.
    * In `intro (h : t)`, elaboration of `t` is interleaved with unification with the type of `h`, which prevents default instances from causing unification to fail.
    * Tactics that change types of hypotheses (including `intro (h : t)`, `delta`, `dsimp`) now update the local instance cache.
  * [#9945](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9945) optimizes the proof terms produced by `grind cutsat`. It removes unused entries from the context objects when generating the final proof, significantly reducing the amount of junk in the resulting terms. Example:

```
/--
trace: [grind.debug.proof] fun h h_1 h_2 h_3 h_4 h_5 h_6 h_7 h_8 =>
      let ctx := RArray.leaf (f 2);
      let p_1 := Poly.add 1 0 (Poly.num 0);
      let p_2 := Poly.add (-1) 0 (Poly.num 1);
      let p_3 := Poly.num 1;
      le_unsat ctx p_3 (eagerReduce (Eq.refl true)) (le_combine ctx p_2 p_1 p_3 (eagerReduce (Eq.refl true)) h_8 h_1)

  grind

```

  * [#9946](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9946) optimizes the proof terms produced by `grind ring`. It is similar to #9945, but for the ring module in `grind`. It removes unused entries from the context objects when generating the final proof, significantly reducing the amount of junk in the resulting terms. Example:

```
/--
trace: [grind.debug.proof] fun h h_1 h_2 h_3 =>
      Classical.byContradiction fun h_4 =>
        let ctx := RArray.branch 1 (RArray.leaf x) (RArray.leaf x⁻¹);

        let e_2 := Expr.num 0;
        let e_3 := Expr.num 1;
        let e_4 := (Expr.var 0).pow 2;

        let m_2 := Mon.mult (Power.mk 0 1) Mon.unit;

        let p_2 := Poly.add (-1) (Mon.mult (Power.mk 0 1) Mon.unit) (Poly.num 0);
        let p_3 := Poly.add 1 (Mon.mult (Power.mk 0 2) Mon.unit) (Poly.num 0);
        let p_4 := Poly.add 1 (Mon.mult (Power.mk 0 1) (Mon.mult (Power.mk 1 1) Mon.unit)) (Poly.num (-1));
        let p_5 := Poly.add 1 (Mon.mult (Power.mk 0 1) Mon.unit) (Poly.num 0);

  * [#9947](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9947) optimizes the proof terms produced by `grind linarith`. It is similar to #9945, but for the `linarith` module in `grind`. It removes unused entries from the context objects when generating the final proof, significantly reducing the amount of junk in the resulting terms.
  * [#9951](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9951) generates `.ctorIdx` functions for all inductive types, not just enumeration types. This can be a building block for other constructions (`BEq`, `noConfusion`) that are size-efficient even for large inductives.
  * [#9952](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9952) adds “non-branching case statements”: For each inductive constructor `T.con` this adds a function `T.con.with` that is similar `T.casesOn`, but has only one arm (the one for `con`), and an additional `t.toCtorIdx = 12` assumption.
  * [#9954](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9954) removes the option `grind +ringNull`. It provided an alternative proof term construction for the `grind ring` module, but it was less effective than the default proof construction mode and had effectively become dead code. also optimizes semiring normalization proof terms using the infrastructure added in #9946. **Remark:** After updating stage0, we can remove several background theorems from the `Init/Grind` folder.
  * [#9958](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9958) ensures that equations in the `grind cutsat` module are maintained in solved form. That is, given an equation `a*x + p = 0` used to eliminate `x`, the linear polynomial `p` must not contain other eliminated variables. Before this PR, equations were maintained in triangular form. We are going to use the solved form to linearize nonlinear terms.
  * [#9968](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9968) modifies macros, which implement non-atomic definitions and `$cmd1 in $cmd2` syntax. These macros involve implicit scopes, introduced through `section` and `namespace` commands. Since sections or namespaces are designed to delimit local attributes, this has led to unintuitive behaviour when applying local attributes to definitions appearing in the above-mentioned contexts. This has been causing the following examples to fail:

```
axiom A : Prop


```

  * [#9974](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9974) registers a parser alias for `Lean.Parser.Command.visibility`. This avoids having to import `Lean.Parser.Command` in simple command macros that use visibilities.
  * [#9980](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9980) fixes a bug in the dynamic variable reordering function used in `grind cutsat`.
  * [#9989](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9989) changes the new extended syntax for `mvcgen` to `mvcgen invariants ... with ...`.
  * [#9995](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9995) almost completely rewrites the inductive predicate recursion algorithm; in particular `IndPredBelow` to function more consistently. Historically, the `brecOn` generation through `IndPredBelow` has been very error-prone -- this should be fixed now since the new algorithm is very direct and doesn't rely on tactics or meta-variables at all. Additionally, the new structural recursion procedure for inductive predicates shares more code with regular structural recursion and thus allows for mutual and nested recursion in the same way it was possible with regular structural recursion. For example, the following works now:

```
mutual


```

  * [#9996](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9996) improves support for nonlinear monomials in `grind cutsat`. For example, given a monomial `a * b`, if `cutsat` discovers that `a = 2`, it now propagates that `a * b = 2 * b`. Recall that nonlinear monomials like `a * b` are treated as variables in `cutsat`, a procedure designed for linear integer arithmetic.
  * [#10007](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10007) lets #print print `private` before `protected`, matching the syntax.
  * [#10008](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10008) fixes a bug in `#eval` where clicking on the evaluated expression could show errors in the Infoview. This was caused by `#eval` not saving the temporary environment that is used when elaborating the expression.
  * [#10010](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10010) improves support for nonlinear `/` and `%` in `grind cutsat`. For example, given `a / b`, if `cutsat` discovers that `b = 2`, it now propagates that `a / b = b / 2`. is similar to #9996, but for `/` and `%`. Example:

```
example (a b c d : Nat)
    : b > 1 → d = 1 → b ≤ d + 1 → a % b = 1 → a = 2 * c → False := by
  grind

```

  * [#10020](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10020) fixes a missing case for PR #10010.
  * [#10021](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10021) make some minor changes to the grind annotation analysis script, including sorting results and handling errors. Still need to add an external UI.
  * [#10022](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10022) improves support for `Fin n` in `grind cutsat` when `n` is not a numeral. For example, the following goals can now be solved automatically:

```
example (p d : Nat) (n : Fin (p + 1))
    : 2 ≤ p → p ≤ d + 1 → d = 1 → n = 0 ∨ n = 1 ∨ n = 2 := by
  grind


```

  * [#10034](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10034) changes the "declaration uses 'sorry'" error to pretty print an actual `sorry` expression in the message. The effect is that the `sorry` is hoverable and, if it's labeled, you can "go to definition" to see where it came from.
  * [#10038](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10038) ensures `grind` error messages use `{.ofConstName declName}` when referencing declaration names.
  * [#10060](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10060) allows for more fine-grained control over what derived instances have exposed definitions under the module system: handlers should not expose their implementation unless either the deriving item or a surrounding section is marked with `@[expose]`. Built-in handlers to be updated after a stage 0 update.
  * [#10069](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10069) adds helper theorems to support `NatModule` in `grind linarith`.
  * [#10071](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10071) improves support for `a^n` in `grind cutsat`. For example, if `cutsat` discovers that `a` and `b` are equal to numerals, it now propagates the equality. It is similar to #9996, but for `a^b`. Example:

```
example (n : Nat) : n = 2 → 2 ^ (n+1) = 8 := by
  grind

```

  * [#10085](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10085) adds a parser alias for the `rawIdent` parser, so that it can be used in `syntax` declarations in `Init`.
  * [#10093](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10093) adds background theorems for a new solver to be implemented in `grind` that will support associative and commutative operators.
  * [#10095](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10095) modifies the `grind` algebra type classes to use `SMul x y` instead of `HMul x y y`.
  * [#10105](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10105) adds support for detecting associative operators in `grind`. The new AC module also detects whether the operator is commutative, idempotent, and whether it has a neutral element. The information is cached.
  * [#10113](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10113) deprecates `.toCtorIdx` for the more naturally named `.ctorIdx` (and updates the standard library).
  * [#10120](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10120) fixes an issue where private definitions recursively invoked using generalized field notation (dot notation) would give an "invalid field" error. It also fixes an issue where "invalid field notation" errors would pretty print the name of the declaration with a `_private` prefix.
  * [#10125](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10125) allows `#guard_msgs` to report the relative positions of logged messages with the config option `(positions := true)`.
  * [#10129](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10129) replaces the interim order type classes used by `Grind` with the new publicly available classes in `Std`.
  * [#10134](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10134) makes the generation of functional induction principles more robust when the user `let`-binds a variable that is then `match`'ed on. Fixes #10132.
  * [#10135](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10135) lets the `ctorIdx` definition for single constructor inductives avoid the pointless `.casesOn`, and uses `macro_inline` to avoid compiling the function and wasting symbols.
  * [#10141](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10141) reverts the `macro_inline` part of #10135.
  * [#10144](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10144) changes the construction of a `CompleteLattice` instance on predicates (maps intro `Prop`) inside of `coinductive_fixpoint`/`inductive_fixpoint` machinery.
  * [#10146](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10146) implements the basic infrastructure for the new procedure handling AC operators in `grind`. It already supports normalizing disequalities. Future PRs will add support for simplification using equalities, and computing critical pairs. Examples:

```
example {α : Sort u} (op : α → α → α) [Std.Associative op] (a b c : α)
    : op a (op b c) = op (op a b) c := by
  grind only


```

  * [#10151](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10151) ensures `where finally` tactics can access private data under the module system even when the corresponding holes are in the public scope as long as all of them are of proposition types.
  * [#10152](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10152) introduces an alternative construction for `DecidableEq` instances that avoids the quadratic overhead of the default construction.
  * [#10166](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10166) reviews the expected-to-fail-right-now tests for `grind`, moving some (now passing) tests to the main test suite, updating some tests, and adding some tests about normalisation of exponents.
  * [#10177](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10177) fixes a bug in the `grind` preprocessor exposed by #10160.
  * [#10179](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10179) fixes `grind` instance normalization procedure. Some modules in grind use builtin instances defined directly in core (e.g., `cutsat`), while others synthesize them using `synthInstance` (e.g., `ring`). This inconsistency is problematic, as it may introduce mismatches and result in two different representations for the same term. fixes the issue.
  * [#10183](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10183) lets match equations be proved by `rfl` if possible, instead of explicitly unfolding the LHS first. May lead to smaller proofs.
  * [#10185](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10185) documents all `grind` attribute modifiers (e.g., `=`, `usr`, `ext`, etc).
  * [#10186](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10186) adds supports for simplifying disequalities in the `grind ac` module.
  * [#10189](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10189) implements the proof terms for the new `grind ac` module. Examples:

```
example {α : Sort u} (op : α → α → α) [Std.Associative op] (a b c d : α)
    : op a (op b b) = op c d → op c (op d c) = op (op a b) (op b c) := by
  grind only


```

  * [#10205](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10205) adds superposition for associative and commutative operators in `grind ac`. Examples:

```
example (a b c d e f g h : Nat) :
    max a b = max c d → max b e = max d f → max b g = max d h →
    max (max f d) (max c g) = max (max e (max d (max b (max c e)))) h := by
  grind -cutsat only


```

  * [#10206](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10206) adds superposition for associative (but non-commutative) operators in `grind ac`. Examples:

```
example {α} (op : α → α → α) [Std.Associative op] (a b c d : α)
   : op a b = c →
     op b a = d →
     op (op c a) (op b c) = op (op a d) (op d b) := by
  grind


```

  * [#10208](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10208) adds the extra critical pairs to ensure the `grind ac` procedure is complete when the operator is AC and idempotent. Example:

```
example {α : Sort u} (op : α → α → α) [Std.Associative op] [Std.Commutative op] [Std.IdempotentOp op]
      (a b c d : α) : op a (op b b) = op d c → op (op b a) (op b c) = op c (op d c)  := by
  grind only

```

  * [#10221](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10221) adds the extra critical pairs to ensure the `grind ac` procedure is complete when the operator is associative and idempotent, but not commutative. Example:

```
example {α : Sort u} (op : α → α → α) [Std.Associative op] [Std.IdempotentOp op] (a b c d e f x y w : α)
    : op d (op x c) = op a b →
      op e (op f (op y w)) = op a (op b c) →
      op d (op x c) = op e (op f (op y w)) := by
  grind only


```

  * [#10223](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10223) implements equality propagation from the new AC module into the `grind` core. Examples:

```
example {α β : Sort u} (f : α → β) (op : α → α → α) [Std.Associative op] [Std.Commutative op]
    (a b c d : α) : op a (op b b) = op d c → f (op (op b a) (op b c)) = f (op c (op d c)) := by
  grind only


```

  * [#10230](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10230) adds `MonoBind` for more monad transformers. This allows using `partial_fixpoint` for more complicated monads based on `Option` and `EIO`. Example:

```
abbrev M := ReaderT String (StateT String.Pos Option)


```

  * [#10237](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10237) fixes a missing case in the `grind` canonicalizer. Some types may include terms or propositions that are internalized later in the `grind` state.
  * [#10239](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10239) fixes the E-matching procedure for theorems that contain universe parameters not referenced by any regular parameter. This kind of theorem seldom happens in practice, but we do have instances in the standard library. Example:

```
@[simp, grind =] theorem Std.Do.SPred.down_pure {φ : Prop} : (⌜φ⌝ : SPred []).down = φ := rfl

```

  * [#10241](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10241) adds some test cases for `grind` working with `Fin`. There are many still failing tests in `tests/lean/grind/grind_fin.lean` which I'm intending to triage and work on.
  * [#10245](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10245) changes the implementation of a function `unfoldPredRel` used in (co)inductive predicate machinery, that unfolds pointwise order on predicates to quantifications and implications. Previous implementation relied on `withDeclsDND` that could not deal with types which depend on each other. This caused the following example to fail:

```
inductive infSeq_functor1.{u} {α : Type u} (r : α → α → Prop) (call : {α : Type u} → (r : α → α → Prop) → α → Prop) : α → Prop where
  | step : r a b → infSeq_functor1 r call b → infSeq_functor1 r call a


```

  * [#10265](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10265) fixes a panic in `grind ring` exposed by #10242. `grind ring` should not assume that all normalizations have been applied, because some subterms cannot be rewritten by `simp` due to typing constraints. Moreover, `grind` uses `preprocessLight` in a few places, and it skips the simplifier/normalizer.
  * [#10267](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10267) implements the infrastructure for supporting `NatModule` in `grind linarith` and uses it to handle disequalities. Another PR will add support for equalities and inequalities. Example:

```
open Lean Grind
variable (M : Type) [NatModule M] [AddRightCancel M]


```

  * [#10269](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10269) changes the string interpolation procedure to omit redundant empty parts. For example `s!"{1}{2}"` previously elaborated to `toString "" ++ toString 1 ++ toString "" ++ toString 2 ++ toString ""` and now elaborates to `toString 1 ++ toString 2`.
  * [#10271](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10271) changes the naming of the internal functions in deriving instances like BEq to use accessible names. This is necessary to reasonably easily prove things about these functions. For example after `deriving BEq` for a type `T`, the implementation of `instBEqT` is in `instBEqT.beq`.
  * [#10273](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10273) tries to do the right thing about the visibility of the same-ctor-match-construct.
  * [#10274](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10274) changes the implementation of the linear `DecidableEq` implementation to use `match decEq` rather than `if h : ` to compare the constructor tags. Otherwise, the “smart unfolding” machinery will not let `rfl` decide that different constructors are different.
  * [#10277](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10277) adds the missing instances `IsPartialOrder`, `IsLinearPreorder` and `IsLinearOrder` for `OfNatModule.Q α`.
  * [#10278](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10278) adds support for `NatModule` equalities and inequalities in `grind linarith`. Examples:

```
open Lean Grind Std


```

  * [#10280](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10280) adds the auxiliary theorem `Lean.Grind.Linarith.eq_normN` for normalizing `NatModule` equations when the instance `AddRightCancel` is not available.
  * [#10281](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10281) implements `NatModule` normalization when the `AddRightCancel` instance is not available. Note that in this case, the embedding into `IntModule` is not injective. Therefore, we use a custom normalizer, similar to the `CommSemiring` normalizer used in the `grind ring` module. Example:

```
open Lean Grind
example [NatModule α] (a b c : α)
    : 2•a + 2•(b + 2•c) + 3•a = 4•a + c + 2•b + 3•c + a := by
  grind

```

  * [#10282](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10282) improves the counterexamples produced by `grind linarith` for `NatModule`s. `grind` now hides occurrences of the auxiliary function `Grind.IntModule.OfNatModule.toQ`.
  * [#10283](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10283) implements diagnostic information for the `grind ac` module. It now displays the basis, normalized disequalities, and additional properties detected for each associative operator.
  * [#10290](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10290) adds infrastructure for registering new `grind` solvers. `grind` already includes many solvers, and this PR is the first step toward modularizing the design and supporting user-defined solvers.
  * [#10294](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10294) completes the `grind` solver extension design and ports the `grind ac` solver to the new framework. Future PRs will document the API and port the remaining solvers. An additional benefit of the new design is faster build times.
  * [#10296](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10296) fixes a bug in an auxiliary function used to construct proof terms in `grind cutsat`.
  * [#10300](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10300) offers an alternative `noConfusion` construction for the off-diagonal use (i.e. for different constructors), based on comparing the `.ctorIdx`. This should lead to faster type checking, as the kernel only has to reduce `.ctorIdx` twice, instead of the complicate `noConfusionType` construction.
  * [#10301](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10301) exposes ctorIdx and per-constructor eliminators. Fixes #10299.
  * [#10306](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10306) fixes a few bugs in the `rw` tactic: it could "steal" goals because they appear in the type of the rewrite, it did not do an occurs check, and new proof goals would not be synthetic opaque. also lets the `rfl` tactic assign synthetic opaque metavariables so that it is equivalent to `exact rfl`.
  * [#10307](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10307) upstreams the Verso parser and adds preliminary support for Verso in docstrings. This will allow the compiler to check examples and cross-references in documentation.
  * [#10309](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10309) modifies the `simpa` tactic so that in `simpa ... using e` there is tactic info on the range `simpa ... using` that shows the simplified goal.
  * [#10313](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10313) adds missing `grind` normalization rules for `natCast` and `intCast` Examples:

```
open Lean.Grind
variable (R : Type) (a b : R)


```

  * [#10314](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10314) skips model based theory combination on instances.
  * [#10315](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10315) adds `T.ctor.noConfusion` declarations, which are specializations of `T.noConfusion` to equalities between `T.ctor`. The point is to avoid reducing the `T.noConfusionType` construction every time we use `injection` or a similar tactic.
  * [#10316](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10316) shares common functionality relate to equalities between same constructors, and when these are type-correct. In particular it uses the more complete logic from `mkInjectivityThm` also in other places, such as `CasesOnSameCtor` and the deriving code for `BEq`, `DecidableEq`, `Ord`, for more consistency and better error messages.
  * [#10321](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10321) ensures that the auxiliary temporary metavariable IDs created by the E-matching module used in `grind` are not affected by what has been executed before invoking `grind`. The goal is to increase `grind`’s robustness.
  * [#10322](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10322) introduces limited functionality frontends `cutsat` and `grobner` for `grind`. We disable theorem instantiation (and case splitting for `grobner`), and turn off all other solvers. Both still allow `grind` configuration options, so for example one can use `cutsat +ring` (or `grobner +cutsat`) to solve problems that require both.
  * [#10323](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10323) fixes the `grind` canonicalizer for `OfNat.ofNat` applications. Example:

```
example {C : Type} (h : Fin 2 → C) :
    -- `0` in the first `OfNat.ofNat` is not a raw literal
    h (@OfNat.ofNat (Fin (1 + 1)) 0 Fin.instOfNat) = h 0 := by
  grind

```

  * [#10324](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10324) disables an unused instance that causes expensive type class searches.
  * [#10325](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10325) implements model-based theory combination for types `A` which implement the `ToInt` interface. Examples:

```
example {C : Type} (h : Fin 4 → C) (x : Fin 4)
    : 3 ≤ x → x ≤ 3 → h x = h (-1) := by
  grind


```

  * [#10326](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10326) fixes a performance issue in `grind linarith`. It was creating unnecessary `NatModule`/`IntModule` structures for commutative rings without an order. This kind of type should be handled by `grind ring` only.
  * [#10331](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10331) implements `mkNoConfusionImp` in Lean rather than in C. This reduces our reliance on C, and may bring performance benefits from not reducing `noConfusionType` during elaboration time (it still gets reduced by the kernel when type-checking).
  * [#10332](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10332) ensures that the infotree recognizes `Classical.propDecidable` as an instance, when below a `classical` tactic.
  * [#10335](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10335) fixes the nested proof term detection in `grind`. It must check whether the gadget `Grind.nestedProof` is over-applied.
  * [#10342](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10342) implements a new E-matching pattern inference procedure that is faithful to the behavior documented in the reference manual regarding minimal indexable subexpressions. The old inference procedure was failing to enforce this condition. For example, the manual documents `[grind ->]` as follows
  * [#10373](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10373) adds a `pp.unicode` option and a `unicode("→", "->")` syntax description alias for the lower-level `unicodeSymbol "→" "->"` parser. The syntax is added to the `notation` command as well. When `pp.unicode` is true (the default) then the first form is used when pretty printing, and otherwise the second ASCII form is used. A variant, `unicode("→", "->", preserveForPP)` causes the `->` form to be preferred; delaborators can insert `→` directly into the syntax, which will be pretty printed as-is; this allows notations like `fun` to use custom options such as `pp.unicode.fun` to opt into the unicode form when pretty printing.


##  Library[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Library "Permalink")
  * [#7858](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7858) implements the fast circuit for overflow detection in unsigned multiplication used by Bitwuzla and proposed in: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=987767
  * [#9127](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9127) makes `saveModuleData` throw an IO.Error instead of panicking, if given something that cannot be serialized. This doesn't really matter for saving modules, but is handy when writing tools to save auxiliary data in olean files via Batteries' `pickle`.
  * [#9560](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9560) fixes the `forIn` function, that previously caused the resulting Promise to be dropped without a value when an exception was thrown inside of it. It also corrects the parameter order of the `background` function.
  * [#9599](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9599) adds the type `Std.Internal.Parsec.Error`, which contains the constructors `.eof` (useful for checking if parsing failed due to not having enough input and then retrying when more input arrives that is useful in the HTTP server) and `.other`, which describes other errors. It also adds documentation to many functions, along with some new functions to the `ByteArray` Parsec, such as `peekWhen?`, `octDigit`, `takeWhile`, `takeUntil`, `skipWhile`, and `skipUntil`.
  * [#9632](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9632) adds lemmas for the `TreeMap` operations `filter`, `map` and `filterMap`. These lemmas existed already for hash maps and are simply ported over from there.
  * [#9685](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9685) verifies `toArray` and related functions for hashmaps.
  * [#9797](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9797) provides the means to quickly provide all the order instances associated with some high-level order structure (preorder, partial order, linear preorder, linear order). This can be done via the factory functions `PreorderPackage.ofLE`, `PartialOrderPackage.ofLE`, `LinearPreorderPackage.ofLE` and `LinearOrderPackage.ofLE`.
  * [#9908](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9908) makes `IsPreorder`, `IsPartialOrder`, `IsLinearPreorder` and `IsLinearOrder` extend `BEq` and `Ord` as appropriate, adds the `LawfulOrderBEq` and `LawfulOrderOrd` type classes relating `BEq` and `Ord` to `LE`, and adds many lemmas and instances.
  * [#9916](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9916) provides factories that derive order type classes in bulk, given an `Ord` instance. If present, existing instances are preferred over those derived from `Ord`. It is possible to specify any instance manually if desired.
  * [#9924](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9924) fixes examples in the documentation for `PostCond`.
  * [#9931](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9931) implements `Std.Do.Triple.mp`, enabling users to compose two specifications for the same program.
  * [#9949](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9949) allows most of the `List.lookup` lemmas to be used when `LawfulBEq α` is not available.
  * [#9957](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9957) upstreams the definition of Rat from Batteries, for use in our planned interval arithmetic tactic.
  * [#9967](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9967) removes local `Triple` notation from SpecLemmas.lean to work around a bug that breaks the stage2 build.
  * [#9979](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9979) replaces `Std.Internal.Rat` with the new public `Rat` upstreamed from Batteries.
  * [#9987](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9987) improves the tactic for proving that elements of a `Nat`-based `PRange` are in-bounds by relying on the `omega` tactic.
  * [#9993](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9993) defines the dyadic rationals, showing they are an ordered ring embedding into the rationals. We will use this for future interval arithmetic tactics.
  * [#9999](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9999) reduces the number of `Nat.Bitwise` grind annotations we have the deal with distributivity. The new smaller set encourages `grind` to rewrite into DNF. The old behaviour just resulted in saturating up to the instantiation limits.
  * [#10000](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10000) removes a `grind` annotation that fired on all `Option.map`s, causing an avalanche of instantiations.
  * [#10005](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10005) shortens the work necessary to make a type compatible with the polymorphic range notation. In the concrete case of `Nat`, it reduces the required lines of code from 150 to 70.
  * [#10015](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10015) exposes the bodies of `Name.append`, `Name.appendCore`, and `Name.hasMacroScopes`. This enables proof by reflection of the concatenation of name literals when using the module system.
  * [#10018](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10018) derives `BEq` and `Hashable` for `Lean.Import`. Lake already did this later, but it now done when defining `Import`.
  * [#10019](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10019) adds `@[expose]` to `Lean.ParserState.setPos`. This makes it possible to prove in-boundedness for a state produced by `setPos` for functions like `next'` and `get'` without needing to `import all`.
  * [#10024](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10024) adds useful declarations to the `LawfulOrderMin/Max` and `LawfulOrderLeftLeaningMin/Max` API. In particular, it introduces `.leftLeaningOfLE` factories for `Min` and `Max`. It also renames `LawfulOrderMin/Max.of_le` to .of_le_min_iff`and`.of_max_le_iff` and introduces a second variant with different arguments.
  * [#10045](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10045) implements the necessary type classes so that range notation works for integers. For example, `((-2)...3).toList = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2] : List Int`.
  * [#10049](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10049) adds some background material needed for introducing the dyadic rationals in #9993.
  * [#10050](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10050) fixes some naming issues in Data/Rat/Lemmas, and upstreams the eliminator `numDenCasesOn` and its relatives.
  * [#10059](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10059) improves the names of definitions and lemmas in the polymorphic range API. It also introduces a recommended spelling. For example, a left-closed, right-open range is spelled `Rco` in analogy with Mathlib's `Ico` intervals.
  * [#10075](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10075) contains lemmas about `Int` (minor amendments for BitVec and Nat) that are being used in preparing the dyadics. This is all work of @Rob23oba, which I'm pulling out of #9993 early to keep that one manageable.
  * [#10077](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10077) upstreams lemmas about `Rat` from `Mathlib.Data.Rat.Defs` and `Mathlib.Algebra.Order.Ring.Unbundled.Rat`, specifically enough to get `Lean.Grind.Field Rat` and `Lean.Grind.OrderedRing Rat`. In addition to the lemmas, instances for `Inv Rat`, `Pow Rat Nat` and `Pow Rat Int` have been upstreamed.
  * [#10107](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10107) adds the `Lean.Grind.AddCommGroup` instance for `Rat`.
  * [#10138](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10138) adds lemmas about the `Dyadic.roundUp` and `Dyadic.roundDown` operations.
  * [#10159](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10159) adds `nodup_keys` lemmas as corollaries of existing `distinct_keys` to all `Map` variants.
  * [#10162](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10162) removes `grind →` annotations that fire too often, unhelpfully. It would be nice for `grind` to instantiate these lemmas, but only if they already see `xs ++ ys` and `#[]` in the same equivalence class, not just as soon as it sees `xs ++ ys`.
  * [#10163](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10163) removes some (hopefully) unnecessary `grind` annotations that cause instantiation explosions.
  * [#10173](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10173) removes the `extends Monad` from `MonadAwait` and `MonadAsync` to avoid underdetermined instances.
  * [#10182](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10182) adds lemmas about `Nat.fold` and `Nat.foldRev` on sums, to match the existing theorems about `dfold` and `dfoldRev`.
  * [#10194](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10194) adds the inverse of a dyadic rational, at a given precision, and characterising lemmas. Also cleans up various parts of the `Int.DivMod` and `Rat` APIs, and proves some characterising lemmas about `Rat.toDyadic`.
  * [#10216](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10216) fixes #10193.
  * [#10224](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10224) generalizes the monadic operations for `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `HashSet` to work for `m : Type u → Type v`.
  * [#10227](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10227) adds `@[grind]` annotations (nearly all `@[grind =]` annotations parallel to existing `@[simp]`s) for `ReaderT`, `StateT`, `ExceptT`.
  * [#10244](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10244) adds more lemmas about the `toList` and `toArray` functions on ranges and iterators. It also renames `Array.mem_toArray` into `List.mem_toArray`.
  * [#10247](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10247) adds missing the lemmas `ofList_eq_insertMany_empty`, `get?_eq_some_iff`, `getElem?_eq_some_iff` and `getKey?_eq_some_iff` to all container types.
  * [#10250](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10250) fixes a bug in the `LinearOrderPackage.ofOrd` factory. If there is a `LawfulEqOrd` instance available, it should automatically use it instead of requiring the user to provide the `eq_of_compare` argument to the factory. The PR also solves a hygiene-related problem making the factories fail when `Std` is not open.
  * [#10303](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10303) adds range support to`BitVec` and the `UInt*` types. This means that it is now possible to write, for example, `for i in (1 : UInt8)...5 do`, in order to loop over the values 1, 2, 3 and 4 of type `UInt8`.
  * [#10341](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10341) moves the definitions and basic facts about `Function.Injective` and `Function.Surjective` up from Mathlib. We can do a better job of arguing via injectivity in `grind` if these are available.


##  Compiler[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Compiler "Permalink")
  * [#9631](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9631) makes `IO.RealWorld` opaque. It also adds a new compiler -only `lcRealWorld` constant to represent this type within the compiler. By default, an opaque type definition is treated like `lcAny`, whereas we want a more efficient representation. At the moment, this isn't a big difference, but in the future we would like to completely erase `IO.RealWorld` at runtime.
  * [#9922](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9922) changes `internalizeCode` to replace all substitutions with non-param-bound fvars in `Expr`s (which are all types) with `lcAny`, preserving the invariant that there are no such dependencies. The violation of this invariant across files caused test failures in a pending PR, but it is difficult to write a direct test for it. In the future, we should probably change the LCNF checker to detect this.
  * [#9972](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9972) fixes an issue when running Mathlib's `FintypeCat` as code, where an erased type former is passed to a polymorphic function. We were lowering the arrow type to`object`, which conflicts with the runtime representation of an erased value as a tagged scalar.
  * [#9977](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9977) adds support for compilation of `casesOn` recursors of subsingleton predicates.
  * [#10023](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10023) adds support for correctly handling computations on fields in `casesOn` for inductive predicates that support large elimination. In any such predicate, the only relevant fields allowed are those that are also used as an index, in which case we can find the supplied index and use that term instead.
  * [#10032](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10032) changes the handling of overapplied constructors when lowering LCNF to IR from a (slightly implicit) assertion failure to producing `unreachable`. Transformations on inlined unreachable code can produce constructor applications with additional arguments.
  * [#10040](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10040) changes the `toMono` pass to replace decls with their `_redArg` equivalent, which has the consequence of not considering arguments deemed useless by the `reduceArity` pass for the purposes of the `noncomputable` check.
  * [#10070](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10070) fixes the compilation of `noConfusion` by repairing an oversight made when porting this code from the old compiler. The old compiler only repeatedly expanded the major for each non-`Prop` field of the inductive under consideration, mirroring the construction of `noConfusion` itself, whereas the new compiler erroneously counted all fields.

##  Pretty Printing[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Pretty-Printing "Permalink")
  * [#10122](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10122) adds support for pretty printing using generalized field notation (dot notation) for private definitions on public types. It also modifies dot notation elaboration to resolve names after removing the private prefix, which enables using dot notation for private definitions on private imported types.
  * [#10373](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10373) adds a `pp.unicode` option and a `unicode("→", "->")` syntax description alias for the lower-level `unicodeSymbol "→" "->"` parser. The syntax is added to the `notation` command as well. When `pp.unicode` is true (the default) then the first form is used when pretty printing, and otherwise the second ASCII form is used. A variant, `unicode("→", "->", preserveForPP)` causes the `->` form to be preferred; delaborators can insert `→` directly into the syntax, which will be pretty printed as-is; this allows notations like `fun` to use custom options such as `pp.unicode.fun` to opt into the unicode form when pretty printing.
  * [#10374](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10374) adds the options `pp.piBinderNames` and `pp.piBinderNames.hygienic`. Enabling `pp.piBinderNames` causes non-dependent pi binder names to be pretty printed, rather than be omitted. When `pp.piBinderNames.hygienic` is false (the default) then only non-hygienic such biner names are pretty printed. Setting `pp.all` enables `pp.piBinderNames` if it is not otherwise explicitly set.

  * [#9956](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9956) adds additional information to the `let` and `have` tactic docstrings about opaqueness, when to use each, and associated tactics.


##  Server[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Server "Permalink")
  * [#9966](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9966) adjusts the "try this" widget to be rendered as a widget message under 'Messages', not a separate widget under a 'Suggestions' section. The main benefit of this is that the message of the widget is not duplicated between 'Messages' and 'Suggestions'.
  * [#10047](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10047) ensures that hovering over `match` displays the type of the match.
  * [#10052](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10052) fixes a bug that caused the Lean server process tree to survive the closing of VS Code.
  * [#10249](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10249) speeds up auto-completion by a factor of ~3.5x through various performance improvements in the language server. On one machine, with `import Mathlib`, completing `i` used to take 3200ms and now instead yields a result in 920ms.


##  Lake[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___24___0-_LPAR_2025-10-14_RPAR_--Lake "Permalink")
  * [#9749](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/9749) refactors the Lake codebase to use the new module system throughout. Every module in `Lake` is now a `module`.
  * [#10276](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10276) moves the `verLit` syntax into the `Lake.DSL` namespace to be consistent with other code found in `Lake.DSL`.

  * [#10043](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10043) allows Lean's parser to run with a final position prior to the end of the string, so it can be invoked on a sub-region of the input.
  * [#10217](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10217) ensures `@[init]` declarations such as from `initialize` are run in the order they were declared on import.
  * [#10262](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/10262) adds a new option `maxErrors` that limits the number of errors printed from a single `lean` run, defaulting to 100. Processing is aborted when the limit is reached, but this is tracked only on a per-command level.
