##  Highlights[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___21___0-_LPAR_2025-06-30_RPAR_--Highlights "Permalink")
_'Unknown identifier' code actions_
  * [#7665](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7665) and [#8180](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8180) add support for code actions that resolve 'Unknown identifier' errors by either importing the missing declaration or by changing the identifier to one from the environment.


_New Language Features_
  * [#8449](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8449) and [#8516](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8516) upstream and extend the Mathlib `clear_value` tactic. Given a local definition `x : T := v`, the tactic `clear_value x` replaces it with a hypothesis `x : T`, or throws an error if the goal does not depend on the value `v`. The syntax `clear_value (h : x = _)` creates a hypothesis `h : x = _` before clearing the value of `x`. Any expression definitionally equal to `x` can be used in place of the underscore. Furthermore, `clear_value *` clears all values that can be cleared, or throws an error if none can be cleared.
  * [#8512](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8512) adds a `value_of% ident` term that elaborates to the value of the local or global constant `ident`. This is useful for creating definition hypotheses:

```
let x := ... complicated expression ...
have hx : x = value_of% x := rfl

```

  * [#8450](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8450) adds a feature to the `subst` tactic so that when `x : X := v` is a local definition, `subst x` substitutes `v` for `x` in the goal and removes `x`. Previously the tactic would throw an error.
  * [#8037](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8037) introduces a `noConfusionType` construction that’s sub-quadratic in size, and reduces faster. The previous `noConfusion` construction with two nested `match` statements is quadratic in size and reduction behavior. Using some helper definitions, a linear size construction is possible.
  * [#8104](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8104) makes `fun_induction` and `fun_cases` (try to) unfold the function application of interest in the goal. The old behavior can be enabled with `set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding false`. For `fun_cases` this does not work yet when the function’s result type depends on one of the arguments, see issue [#8296](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/8296).
  * [#8171](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8171) omits cases from functional induction/cases principles that are implemented `by contradiction` (or, more generally, `False.elim`, `absurd` or `noConfusion). **Breaking change** in the sense that there are fewer goals to prove after using functional induction.
  * [#8106](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8106) adds a `register_linter_set` command for declaring linter sets. The `getLinterValue` function now checks if the present linter is contained in a set that has been enabled (using the `set_option` command or on the command line).
  * [#8267](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8267) makes `#guard_msgs` to treat `trace` messages separate from `info`, `warning` and `error`. It also introduces the ability to say `#guard_msgs (pass info)`, like `(drop info)` so far, and also adds `(check info)` as the explicit form of `(info)`, for completeness.


_Library Highlights_
  * [#8358](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8358) introduces a very minimal version of the new iterator library. It comes with list iterators and various consumers, namely `toArray`, `toList`, `toListRev`, `ForIn`, `fold`, `foldM` and `drain`. All consumers also come in a partial variant that can be used without any proofs. This limited version of the iterator library generates decent code, even with the old code generator.
  * [#7352](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7352) reworks the `simp` set around the `Id` monad, to not elide or unfold `pure` and `Id.run`
  * [#8313](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8313) changes the definition of `Vector` so it no longer extends `Array`. This prevents `Array` API from "leaking through".


_Other Highlights_
  * Performance optimizations in `dsimp`:
    * [#6973](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/6973) stops `dsimp` from visiting proof terms, which should make `simp` and `dsimp` more efficient.
    * [#7428](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7428) adds a `dsimp` cache to `simp`. Previously each `dsimp` call from `simp` started with a fresh cache. As a result, time spent in `simp` while compiling Mathlib is reduced by over 45%, giving an overall 8% speedup to Mathlib compilation.
  * [#8221](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8221) adjusts the experimental module system to not export the bodies of `def`s unless opted out by the new attribute `@[expose]` on the `def` or on a surrounding `section`.
  * [#8559](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8559) and [#8560](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8560) fix an adversarial soundness attack described in [#8554](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8554). The attack exploits the fact that `assert!` no longer aborts execution, and that users can redirect error messages.

  * [#6973](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/6973) stops `dsimp` from visiting proof terms, which should make `simp` and `dsimp` more efficient.
  * [#7428](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7428) adds a `dsimp` cache to `simp`. Previously each `dsimp` call from `simp` started with a fresh cache. As a result, time spent in `simp` while compiling Mathlib is reduced by over 45%, giving an overall 8% speedup to Mathlib compilation.
  * [#7631](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7631) fixes `Lean.Level.mkIMaxAux` (`mk_imax` in the kernel) such that `imax 1 u` reduces to `u`.
  * [#7977](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7977) adds basic support for eta-reduction to `grind`.
  * [#8002](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8002) fixes an issue where "go to definition" for variables generalized by the `induction` and `cases` tactic did not work. Closes #2873.
  * [#8024](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8024) adds the `--setup` option to the `lean` CLI. It takes a path to a JSON file containing information about a module's imports and configuration, superseding that in the module's own file header. This will be used by Lake to specify paths to module artifacts (e.g., oleans and ileans) separate from the `LEAN_PATH` schema.
  * [#8037](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8037) introduces a `noConfusionType` construction that’s sub-quadratic in size, and reduces faster.
  * [#8104](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8104) makes `fun_induction` and `fun_cases` (try to) unfold the function application of interest in the goal. The old behavior can be enabled with `set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding false`. For `fun_cases` this does not work yet when the function’s result type depends on one of the arguments, see issue #8296.
  * [#8106](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8106) adds a `register_linter_set` command for declaring linter sets. The `getLinterValue` function now checks if the present linter is contained in a set that has been enabled (using the `set_option` command or on the command line).
  * [#8169](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8169) makes the whitespace handling in the syntax of `omit` and `include` consistent with `variable`.
  * [#8171](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8171) omits cases from functional induction/cases principles that are implemented `by contradiction` (or, more generally, `False.elim`, `absurd` or `noConfusion). Breaking change in the sense that there are fewer goals to prove after using functional induction.
  * [#8196](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8196) improves the E-matching pattern inference procedure in `grind`. Consider the following theorem:

```
@[grind →]
theorem eq_empty_of_append_eq_empty {xs ys : Array α} (h : xs ++ ys = #[]) : xs = #[] ∧ ys = #[] :=
  append_eq_empty_iff.mp h

```

Before this PR, `grind` inferred the following pattern:

```
@HAppend.hAppend _ _ _ _ #2 #1

```

Note that this pattern would match any `++` application, even if it had nothing to do with arrays. With this PR, the inferred pattern becomes:

```
@HAppend.hAppend (Array #3) (Array _) (Array _) _ #2 #1

```

With the new pattern, the theorem will not be considered by `grind` for goals that do not involve `Array`s.
  * [#8198](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8198) fixes an issue in the theory propagation used in `grind`. When two equivalence classes are merged, the core may need to push additional equalities or disequalities down to the satellite theory solvers (e.g., `cutsat`, `comm ring`, etc). Some solvers (e.g. `cutsat`) assume that all of the core’s invariants hold before they receive those facts. Propagating immediately therefore risks violating a solver’s pre-conditions midway through the merge. To decouple the merge operation from propagation and to keep the core solver-agnostic, this PR adds the helper type `PendingTheoryPropagation`.
  * [#8208](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8208) reduces the need for defeq in frequently used bv_decide rewrite by turning them into simprocs that work on structural equality instead. As the intended meaning of these rewrites is to simply work with structural equality anyways this should not change the proving power of `bv_decide`'s rewriter but just make it faster on certain very large problems.
  * [#8209](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8209) fixes a nondeterminism issue in the `grind` tactic. It was a bug in the model-based theory combination module.
  * [#8221](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8221) adjusts the experimental module system to not export the bodies of `def`s unless opted out by the new attribute `@[expose]` on the `def` or on a surrounding `section`.
  * [#8224](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8224) adds diagnostic information for the commutative ring procedure in `grind`.
  * [#8226](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8226) fixes the `simplifyBasis` procedure in the commutative ring procedure in `grind`.
  * [#8231](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8231) changes the behaviour of `apply?` so that the `sorry` it uses to close the goal is non-synthetic. (Recall that correct use of synthetic sorries requires that the tactic also generates an error message, which we don't want to do in this situation.) This change defends against the problem reported in [#8212](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/8212).
  * [#8232](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8232) fixes elaboration of constants in the `rewrite` tactic. previously, `rw [eq_self]` would elaborate `eq_self` twice, and add it to the infotree twice. This would lead to the "Expected type" being delaborated with an unknown universe metavariable.
  * [#8241](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8241) changes the behavior of the `rename` tactic to skip over implementation detail hypotheses when finding a hypothesis to rename.
  * [#8254](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8254) fixes unintended inlining of `ToJson`, `FromJson`, and `Repr` instances, which was causing exponential compilation times in `deriving` clauses for large structures.
  * [#8259](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8259) clarifies the invalid field notation error when projected value type is a metavariable.
  * [#8260](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8260) clarifies the invalid dotted identifier notation error when the type is a sort.
  * [#8261](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8261) adjusts the error message when `apply` fails to unify. It is clearer about distinguishing the term being applied and the goal, as well as distinguishing the "conclusion" of the given term and the term itself.
  * [#8262](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8262) improves the type-as-hole error message. Type-as-hole error for theorem declarations should not admit the possibility of omitting the type entirely.
  * [#8264](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8264) rewords the `application type mismatch` error message by more specifically mentioning that the problem is with the final argument. This is useful when the same argument is passed to the function multiple times.
  * [#8267](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8267) makes `#guard_msgs` to treat `trace` messages separate from `info`, `warning` and `error`. It also introduce the ability to say `#guard_msgs (pass info`, like `(drop info)` so far, and also adds `(check info)` as the explicit form of `(info)`, for completeness.
  * [#8270](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8270) makes the enum pass of `bv_decide` handle enum types that are universe polymorphic.
  * [#8271](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8271) changes `addPPExplicitToExposeDiff` to show universe differences and to visit into projections, e.g.:

```
error: tactic 'rfl' failed, the left-hand side
  (Test.mk (∀ (x : PUnit.{1}), True)).1
is not definitionally equal to the right-hand side
  (Test.mk (∀ (x : PUnit.{2}), True)).1

```

for

```
inductive Test where
  | mk (x : Prop)


```

  * [#8275](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8275) ensures the congruence closure in `grind` and find non-dependent arrow congruences. That is, it can apply the `implies_congr` theorem.
  * [#8276](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8276) adds the instances `Grind.CommRing (Fin n)` and `Grind.IsCharP (Fin n) n`. New tests:

```
example (x y z : Fin 13) :
    (x + y + z) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 + z ^ 2 + 2 * (x * y + y * z + z * x) := by
  grind +ring


```

  * [#8277](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8277) improves the generation of `.induct_unfolding` by rewriting `match` statements more reliably, using the new “congruence equations” introduced in #8284. Fixes #8195.
  * [#8280](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8280) adds support for arrows in the congruence closure procedure used in `grind`.
  * [#8281](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8281) improves the module used to prove auxiliary type cast equalities in `grind`.
  * [#8284](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8284) adds a new variant of equations for matchers, namely “congruence equations” that generalize the normal matcher equations. They have unrestricted left-hand-sides, extra equality assumptions relating the discriminants with the patterns and thus prove heterogeneous equalities. In that sense they combine congruence with rewriting. They can be used to rewrite matcher applications where, due to dependencies, `simp` would fail to rewrite the discriminants, and will be used when producing the unfolding induction theorems.
  * [#8285](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8285) fixes “declaration has free variables” errors when generating a splitter for a match statement with named patterns. Fixes #8274.
  * [#8299](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8299) implements a missing preprocessing step in `grind`: abstract metavariables in the goal
  * [#8301](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8301) unfolds functions in the unfolding induction principle properly when they use `bif` (a.k.a. `Bool.cond`).
  * [#8302](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8302) lets `cases` fail gracefully when the motive has a complex argument whose type is dependent on the targets. While the `induction` tactic can handle this well, `cases` does not. This change at least gracefully degrades to not instantiating that motive parameter. See issue [#8296](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/8296) for more details on this issue.
  * [#8303](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8303) fixes missing occurrences of `foldProjs` in `grind`.
  * [#8306](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8306) makes it possible for `bv_decide` to tackle situations for its enum type preprocessing where the enums themselves are use in a dependently type context (for example inside of a `GetElem` body) and thus not trivially accessible to `simp` for rewriting. To do this we drop`GetElem` on `BitVec` as well as `dite` as early as possible in the pipeline.
  * [#8321](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8321) lets the termination argument inference consider negations of Nat comparisons. Fixes [#8257](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/8257).
  * [#8323](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8323) adds support for bv_decide to understand `BitVec.reverse` in bitblasting.
  * [#8330](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8330) improves support for structure extensionality in `grind`. It now uses eta expansion for structures instead of the extensionality theorems generated by `[ext]`. Examples:

```
opaque f (a : Nat) : Nat × Bool


```

  * [#8338](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8338) improves the error messages displayed in `inductive` declarations when type parameters are invalid or absent.
  * [#8341](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8341) fixes the `propagateCtor` constraint propagator used in `grind`.
  * [#8343](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8343) splits `Lean.Grind.CommRing` into 4 type classes, for semirings and noncommutative rings. This does not yet change the behaviour of `grind`, which expects to find all 4 type classes. Later we will make some generalizations.
  * [#8344](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8344) fixes term normalization issues in `grind`, and the new option `grind +etaStruct`.
  * [#8347](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8347) adds draft type classes for `grind` to process facts about ordered modules. These interfaces will evolve as the implementation develops.
  * [#8354](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8354) makes sure that when generating the unfolding functional induction theorem, `mdata` does not get in the way.
  * [#8356](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8356) tries harder to clean internals of the argument packing of n-ary functions from the functional induction theorem, in particular the unfolding variant
  * [#8359](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8359) improves the functional cases principles, by making a more educated guess which function parameters should be targets and which should remain parameters (or be dropped). This simplifies the principles, and increases the chance that `fun_cases` can unfold the function call.
  * [#8361](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8361) fixes a bug in the `cases` tacic introduced in #3188 that arises when cases (not induction) is used with a non-atomic expression in using and the argument indexing gets confused.
  * [#8363](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8363) unifies various ways of naming auxiliary declarations in a conflict-free way and ensures the method is compatible with diverging branches of elaboration such as parallelism or Aesop-like backtracking+replaying search.
  * [#8365](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8365) fixes the transparency mode for ground patterns. This is important for implicit instances. Here is a mwe for an issue detected while testing `grind` in Mathlib.

```
example (a : Nat) : max a a = a := by
  grind


```

  * [#8368](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8368) improves the error messages produced by invalid pattern-match alternatives and improves parity in error placement between pattern-matching tactics and elaborators.
  * [#8369](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8369) fixes a type error at `instantiateTheorem` function used in `grind`. It was failing to instantiate theorems such as

```
theorem getElem_reverse {xs : Array α} {i : Nat} (hi : i < xs.reverse.size)
    : (xs.reverse)[i] = xs[xs.size - 1 - i]'(by simp at hi; omega)

```

in examples such as

```
example (xs : Array Nat) (w : xs.reverse = xs) (j : Nat) (hj : 0 ≤ j) (hj' : j < xs.size / 2)
    : xs[j] = xs[xs.size - 1 - j]

```

generating the issue

```
  [issue] type error constructing proof for Array.getElem_reverse
      when assigning metavariable ?hi with
        ‹j < xs.toList.length›
      has type
        j < xs.toList.length : Prop
      but is expected to have type
        j < xs.reverse.size : Prop

```

  * [#8375](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8375) ensures that using `mapError` to expand an error message uses `addMessageContext` to include the current context, so that expressions are rendered correctly. Also adds a `preprendError` variant with a more convenient argument order for the common cases of prepending-and-indenting.
  * [#8403](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8403) adds missing monotonicity lemmas for universal quantifiers, that are used in defining (co)inductive predicates.
  * [#8410](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8410) fixes a case-splitting heuristic in `grind` and simplifies the proof for test `grind_palindrome2.lean`.
  * [#8412](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8412) fixes the `markNestedProofs` preprocessor used in `grind`. There was a missing case (e.g., `Expr.mdata`)
  * [#8413](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8413) implements normalization rules that pull universal quantifiers across disjunctions. This is a common normalization step performed by first-order theorem provers.
  * [#8417](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8417) introduces `Lean.Grind.Field`, proves that a `IsCharP 0` field satisfies `NoNatZeroDivisors`, and sets up some basic (currently failing) tests for `grind`.
  * [#8426](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8426) adds the attribute `[grind?]`. It is like `[grind]` but displays inferred E-matching patterns. It is more convenient than writing it manually. Thanks @kim-em for suggesting this feature.

```
set_option trace.grind.ematch.pattern true

```

It also improves some tests, and adds the helper function `ENode.isRoot`.
  * [#8429](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8429) adds `Lean.Grind.Ring.IsOrdered`, and cleans up the ring/module `grind` API. These type classes are at present unused, but will support future algorithmic improvements in `grind`.
  * [#8437](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8437) fixes `split` in the presence of metavariables in the target.
  * [#8438](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8438) ensures that `grind` diagnostics are obtained even when `maxHeartbeats` is reached. Also removes some dead code.
  * [#8440](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8440) implements non-chronological backtracking for the `grind` tactic. This feature ensures that `grind` does not need to process irrelevant branches after performing a case-split that is not relevant. It is not just about performance, but also the size of the final proof term. The new test demonstrates this feature in practice.

```
-- In the following test, the first 8 case-splits are irrelevant,
-- and non-choronological backtracking is used to avoid searching
-- (2^8 - 1) irrelevant branches

  * [#8443](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8443) adds the lemmas about ordered rings and ordered fields which will be needed by the new algebraic normalization components of `grind`.
  * [#8449](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8449) upstreams and extends the Mathlib `clear_value` tactic. Given a local definition `x : T := v`, the tactic `clear_value x` replaces it with a hypothesis `x : T`, or throws an error if the goal does not depend on the value `v`. The syntax `clear_value x with h` creates a hypothesis `h : x = v` before clearing the value of `x`. Furthermore, `clear_value *` clears all values that can be cleared, or throws an error if none can be cleared.
  * [#8450](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8450) adds a feature to the `subst` tactic so that when `x : X := v` is a local definition, `subst x` substitutes `v` for `x` in the goal and removes `x`. Previously the tactic would throw an error.
  * [#8466](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8466) fixes another instance of the `grind` issue "unexpected kernel projection term during internalization".
  * [#8472](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8472) avoids name resolution blocking on the elaboration of a theorem's proof when looking up the theorem name.
  * [#8479](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8479) implements hash-consing for `grind` that takes alpha equivalence into account.
  * [#8483](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8483) ensures `grind` reuses the `simp` cache between different calls. Recall that `grind` uses `simp` to normalize terms during internalization.
  * [#8491](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8491) fixes the behavior of `simp_all?` and `simp_all?!`, aligning them with `simp_all` and `simp_all!` respectively.
  * [#8506](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8506) implements `match`-expressions in `grind` using `match` congruence equations. The goal is to minimize the number of `cast` operations that need to be inserted, and avoid `cast` over functions. The new approach support `match`-expressions of the form `match h : ... with ...`.
  * [#8512](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8512) adds a `value_of% ident` term that elaborates to the value of the local or global constant `ident`. This is useful for creating definition hypotheses:

```
let x := ... complicated expression ...
have hx : x = value_of% x := rfl

```

  * [#8516](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8516) is a followup to #8449 to refine the syntax of `clear_value`. The syntax for adding equality hypotheses before clearing values is now `clear_value (h : x = _)`. Any expression definitionally equal to `x` can be used in place of the underscore.
  * [#8536](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8536) fixes the support for `LawfulBEq` and `BEq` in `grind`.
  * [#8541](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8541) ensures that for any nested proof `h : p` in a goal, we propagate that `p` is true in the `grind` tactic.
  * [#8542](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8542) fixes two inappropriate uses of `whnfD` in `grind`. They were potential performance foot guns, and were producing unexpected errors since `whnfD` is not consistently used (and it should not be) in all modules.
  * [#8544](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8544) implements support for over-applied `ite` and `dite` applications in the `grind` tactic. It adds support for propagation and case-split.
  * [#8549](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8549) fixes the hash function used to implement congruence closure in `grind`. The hash of an `Expr` must not depend on whether the expression has been internalized or not.
  * [#8564](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8564) simplifies the interface between the `grind` core and the cutsat procedure. Before this PR, core would try to minimize the number of numeric literals that have to be internalized in cutsat. This optimization was buggy (see `grind_cutsat_zero.lean` test), and produced counterintuitive counterexamples.
  * [#8569](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8569) adds support for generalized E-match patterns to arbitrary theorems.
  * [#8570](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8570) fixes some issues in the E-matching generalized pattern support after the update stage0.
  * [#8572](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8572) adds some generalized `Option` theorems for `grind` . The avoid `casts` operations during E-matching.
  * [#8576](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8576) sets `ring := true` by default in `grind`. It also fixes a bug in the reification procedure, and improves the term internalization in the ring and cutsat modules.


##  Library[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___21___0-_LPAR_2025-06-30_RPAR_--Library "Permalink")
  * [#7352](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7352) reworks the `simp` set around the `Id` monad, to not elide or unfold `pure` and `Id.run`
  * [#7995](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7995) adds a verification of `Array.qsort` properties, trying to use `grind` and `fun_induction` where possible. Currently this is in the `tests/` folder, but once `grind` is ready for production use we will move it out into the library.
  * [#8182](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8182) adds `ofList_eq_insertMany_empty` lemmas for all the hash/tree map types, with the exception of `Std.HashSet.Raw.ofList_eq_insertMany_empty`.
  * [#8188](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8188) takes the existing `getElem_map` statements for `HashMap` variants (also `getElem?`, `getElem!`, and `getD` statements), adds a prime to their name and an explanatory comment, and replaces the unprimed statement with a simpler statement that is only true with `LawfulBEq` present. The original statements which were simp lemmas are now low priority simp lemmas, so the nicer statements should fire when `LawfulBEq` is available.
  * [#8202](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8202) adds an inference that was repeatedly needed when proving `BitVec.msb_sdiv`, and is the symmetric version of `BitVec.one_eq_zero_iff`
  * [#8206](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8206) shows that negating a bitvector created from a natural number equals creating a bitvector from the negative of that number (as an integer).
  * [#8216](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8216) completes adding `@[grind]` annotations for `Option` lemmas, and incidentally fills in some `Option` API gaps/defects.
  * [#8218](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8218) continues adding `@[grind]` attributes for List/Array/Vector, particularly to the lemmas involving the `toList`/`toArray` functions.
  * [#8246](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8246) add `@[grind]` annotations for HashMap and variants.
  * [#8272](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8272) adds lemmas about the length and use of `[]?` on results of `List.intersperse`.
  * [#8291](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8291) changes the statements of `Fin` lemmas to use `[NeZero n] (i : Fin n)` rather than `(i : Fin (n+1))` where possible.
  * [#8298](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8298) adds various `Option` lemmas and defines `Option.filterM` for applicative functors.
  * [#8313](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8313) changes the definition of `Vector` so it no longer extends `Array`. This prevents `Array` API from "leaking through".
  * [#8315](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8315) splits `Std.Classes.Ord` into `Std.Classes.Ord.Basic` (with few imports) and `Std.Classes.Ord.SInt` and `Std.Classes.Ord.Vector`. These changes avoid importing `Init.Data.BitVec.Lemmas` unnecessarily into various basic files. As the new import-only file `Std.Classes.Ord` imports all three of these, end-users are not affected.
  * [#8318](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8318) is follow-up to #8272, combining the conditional lemmas for `getElem_intersperse` into a single lemma with an `if` on the RHS.
  * [#8327](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8327) adds `@[grind]` annotations to the generic `getElem?_eq_none_iff`, `isSome_getElem?`, and `get_getElem?`.
  * [#8328](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8328) adds the `@[grind =]` attribute to all `contains_iff_mem` lemmas.
  * [#8331](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8331) improves the docstring for `PlainDateTime.now` and its variants.
  * [#8346](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8346) adds some missing lemmas about consequences of positivity/non-negativity of `a * b : Int`.
  * [#8349](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8349) fixes the signature of the intended `Inhabited` instance for `ExtDHashMap`.
  * [#8357](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8357) adds variants of `dite_eq_left_iff` that will be useful in a future PR.
  * [#8358](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8358) introduces a very minimal version of the new iterator library. It comes with list iterators and various consumers, namely `toArray`, `toList`, `toListRev`, `ForIn`, `fold`, `foldM` and `drain`. All consumers also come in a partial variant that can be used without any proofs. This limited version of the iterator library generates decent code, even with the old code generator.
  * [#8378](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8378) improves and extends the api around `Ord` and `Ordering`.
  * [#8379](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8379) adds missing `Option` lemmas.
  * [#8380](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8380) provides simple lemmas about `toArray`, `toList` and `toListRev` for the iterator library.
  * [#8384](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8384) provides lemmas about the behavior of `step`, `toArray`, `toList` and `toListRev` on list iterators created with `List.iter` and `List.iterM`.
  * [#8389](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8389) adds the `List/Array/Vector.ofFnM`, the monadic analogues of `ofFn`, along with basic theory.
  * [#8392](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8392) corrects some `Array` lemmas to be about `Array` not `List`.
  * [#8397](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8397) cleans up many duplicate instances (or, in some cases, needlessly duplicated `def X := ...; instance Y := X`).
  * [#8399](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8399) adds variants of `HashMap.getElem?_filter` that assume `LawfulBEq` and have a simpler right-hand-side. `simp` can already achieve these, via rewriting with `getKey_eq` under the lambda. However `grind` can not, and these lemmas help `grind` work with `HashMap` goals. There are variants for all variants of `HashMap`, `getElem?/getElem/getElem!/getD`, and for `filter` and `filterMap`.
  * [#8405](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8405) provides lemmas about the loop constructs `ForIn`, `fold`, `foldM` and `drain` and their relation to each other in the context of iterators.
  * [#8418](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8418) provides the `take` iterator combinator that transforms any iterator into an iterator that stops after a given number of steps. The change contains the implementation and lemmas.
  * [#8422](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8422) adds `LT` and `Decidable` `LT` instances for `Std.Time.Timestamp` and `Std.Time.Duration`.
  * [#8434](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8434) adds the equivalent of `List.take_cons` about `List.drop`.
  * [#8435](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8435) upstreams the `LawfulMonadLift(T)` classes, lemmas and instances from Batteries into Core because the iterator library needs them in order to prove lemmas about the `mapM` operator, which relies on `MonadLiftT`.
  * [#8445](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8445) adds a `@[simp]` lemma, and comments explaining that there is intentionally no verification API for `Vector.take`, `Vector.drop`, or `Vector.tail`, which should all be rewritten in terms of `Vector.extract`.
  * [#8446](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8446) adds basic `@[grind]` annotations for `TreeMap` and its variants. Likely more annotations will be added after we've explored some examples.
  * [#8451](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8451) provides the iterator combinator `filterMap` in a pure and monadic version and specializations `map` and `filter`. This new combinator allows to apply a function to the emitted values of a stream while filtering out certain elements.
  * [#8460](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8460) adds further `@[grind]` annotations for `Option`, as follow-up to the recent additions to the `Option` API in #8379 and #8298.
  * [#8465](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8465) adds further lemmas about `LawfulGetElem`, including marking some with `@[grind]`.
  * [#8470](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8470) adds `@[simp]` to `getElem_pos/neg` (similarly for `getElem!`). These are often already simp lemmas for concrete types.
  * [#8482](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8482) adds preliminary `@[grind]` annotations for `List.Pairwise` and `List.Nodup`.
  * [#8484](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8484) provides the iterator combinator `zip` in a pure and monadic version.
  * [#8492](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8492) adds `simp` lemmas for `toInt_*` and `toNat_*` with arithmetic operation given the hypothesis of no-overflow (`toNat_add_of_not_uaddOverflow`, `toInt_add_of_not_saddOverflow`, `toNat_sub_of_not_usubOverflow`, `toInt_sub_of_not_ssubOverflow`, `toInt_neg_of_not_negOverflow`, `toNat_mul_of_not_umulOverflow`, `toInt_mul_of_not_smulOverflow`). In particular, these are `simp` since (1) the `rhs` is strictly simpler than the `lhs` and (2) this version is also simpler than the standard operation when the hypothesis is available.
  * [#8493](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8493) provides the iterator combinators `takeWhile` (forwarding all emitted values of another iterator until a predicate becomes false) `dropWhile` (dropping values until some predicate on these values becomes false, then forwarding all the others).
  * [#8497](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8497) adds preliminary grind annotations for `List.Sublist`/`IsInfix`/`IsPrefix`/`IsSuffix`, along with test cases.
  * [#8499](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8499) changes the definition of `Array.ofFn.go` to use recursion on `Nat` (rather than well-founded recursion). This resolves a problem reported on [zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/270676-lean4/topic/Memory.20issues.20with.20.60Vector.2EofFn.60.2E/near/520622564)).
  * [#8513](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8513) removes the `@[reducible]` annotation on `Array.size`. This is probably best gone anyway in order to keep separation between the `List` and `Array` APIs, but it also helps avoid uselessly instantiating `Array` theorems when `grind` is working on `List` problems.
  * [#8515](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8515) removes the prime from `Fin.ofNat'`: the old `Fin.ofNat` has completed its 6 month deprecation cycle and is being removed.
  * [#8527](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8527) adds `grind` annotations for theorems about `List.countP` and `List.count`.
  * [#8552](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8552) provides array iterators (`Array.iter(M)`, `Array.iterFromIdx(M)`), infinite iterators produced by a step function (`Iter.repeat`), and a `ForM` instance for finite iterators that is implemented in terms of `ForIn`.
  * [#8620](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8620) removes the `NatCast (Fin n)` global instance (both the direct instance, and the indirect one via `Lean.Grind.Semiring`), as that instance causes `x < n` (for `x : Fin k`, `n : Nat`) to be elaborated as `x < ↑n` rather than `↑x < n`, which is undesirable. Note however that in Mathlib this happens anyway!


##  Compiler[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___21___0-_LPAR_2025-06-30_RPAR_--Compiler "Permalink")
  * [#8211](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8211) adds support for generating IR from the LCNF representation of the new compiler.
  * [#8236](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8236) fixes an issue where the combination of `extern_lib` and `precompileModules` would lead to "symbol not found" errors.
  * [#8268](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8268) optimizes lean_nat_shiftr for scalar operands. The new compiler converts Nat divisions into right shifts, so this now shows up as hot in some profiles.
  * [#8308](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8308) makes the new compiler's specialization pass compute closures the same way as the old compiler, in particular when it comes to variables captured by lambdas.
  * [#8367](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8367) adds a new `structProjCases` pass to the new compiler, analogous to the `struct_cases_on` pass in the old compiler, which converts all projections from structs into `cases` expressions. When lowered to IR, this causes all of the projections from a single structure to be grouped together, which is an invariant relied upon by the IR RC passes (at least for linearity, if not general correctness).
  * [#8409](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8409) adds support to LCNF for native UInt8/UInt16/UInt32/UInt64 literals.
  * [#8456](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8456) adds support for primitive USize literals in LCNF.
  * [#8458](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8458) adds closed term extraction to the new compiler, closely following the approach in the old compiler. In the future, we will explore some ideas to improve upon this approach.
  * [#8462](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8462) enables the LCNF extractClosed pass by default.
  * [#8468](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8468) switches the LCNF baseExt/monoExt environment extensions to use a custom environment extension that uses a PersistentHashMap. The optimizer relies upon the ability to update a decl multiple times, which does not work with SimplePersistentEnvExtension.
  * [#8502](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8502) changes the new compiler to use the kernel environment to find definitions, which causes compilation to be skipped when the decl had a kernel error (e.g. due to an unresolved metavariable). This matches the behavior of the old compiler.
  * [#8521](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8521) makes LCNF.toMono recursively process jmp args.
  * [#8523](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8523) moves the new compiler's noncomputable check into toMono, matching the recent change in the old compiler. This is mildly more complicated because we can't throw an error at the mere use of a constant, we need to check for a later relevant use. This is still a bit more conservative than it could theoretically be around join points and local functions, but it's hard to imagine that mattering in practice (and we can easily enable it if it does).
  * [#8535](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8535) extracts more Nats (and their downstream users) in extractClosed by fixing a silly oversight in the logic.
  * [#8540](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8540) changes the LCNF specialize pass to allow ground variables to depend on local fun decls (with no non-ground free variables). This enables specialization of Monad instances that depend on local lambdas.
  * [#8559](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8559) fixes an adversarial soundness attack described in #8554. The attack exploits the fact that `assert!` no longer aborts execution, and that users can redirect error messages. Another PR will implement the same fix for `Expr.Data`.
  * [#8560](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8560) is similar to #8559 but for `Expr.mkData`. This vulnerability has not been exploited yet, but adversarial users may find a way.
  * [#8561](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8561) increases maxHeartbeats in the isDefEqProjIssue test, because when running under the new compiler the `run_meta` call includes the allocations of the compiler itself. With the old compiler, many of the corresponding allocations were internal to C++ code and would not increase the heartbeat count.
  * [#8565](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8565) makes the LCNF specialization pass only treat type/instance params as ground vars. The current policy was too liberal and would result on computations being floated into specialized loops.
  * [#8566](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8566) changes the LCNF constant folding pass to not convert Nat multiplication to a left shift by a power of 2. The fast path test for this is sufficiently complex that it's simpler to just use the fast path for multiplication.
  * [#8575](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8575) makes LCNF's simpAppApp? bail out on trivial aliases as intended. It seems that there was a typo in the original logic, and this PR also extends it to include aliases of global constants rather than just local vars.
  * [#8582](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8582) fixes an accidental dropping of state in Param.toMono. When this code was originally written, there was no other state besides `typeParams`.


##  Pretty Printing[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___21___0-_LPAR_2025-06-30_RPAR_--Pretty-Printing "Permalink")
  * [#8041](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8041) changes the behavior of `pp.showLetValues` to use a hoverable `⋯` to hide let values. This is now false by default, and there is a new option `pp.showLetValues.threshold` for allowing small expressions to be shown anyway. For tactic metavariables, there is an additional option `pp.showLetValues.tactic.threshold`, which by default is set to the maximal value, since in tactic states local values are usually significant.
  * [#8372](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8372) modifies the pretty printer to use `have` syntax instead of `let_fun` syntax.
  * [#8457](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8457) fixes an issue when including a hard line break in a `Format` that caused subsequent (ordinary) line breaks to be erroneously flattened to spaces.
  * [#8504](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8504) modifies the pretty printer so that dot notation is used for class parent projections. Previously, dot notation was never used for classes.


##  Documentation[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___21___0-_LPAR_2025-06-30_RPAR_--Documentation "Permalink")
  * [#8199](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8199) adds a style guide for documentation, including both general principles and docstring-specific concerns.


##  Server[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___21___0-_LPAR_2025-06-30_RPAR_--Server "Permalink")
  * [#7665](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7665) and [#8180](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8180) add support for code actions that resolve 'Unknown identifier' errors by either importing the missing declaration or by changing the identifier to one from the environment.
  * [#8091](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8091) improves the performance of the workspace symbol request.
  * [#8242](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8242) fixes the 'goals accomplished' diagnostics. They were accidentally broken in #7902.
  * [#8350](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8350) changes namespace completion to use the same algorithm as declaration identifier completion, which makes it use the short name (last name component) for completions instead of the full name, avoiding namespace duplications.
  * [#8362](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8362) fixes a bug where the Unknown identifier code actions wouldn't work correctly for some Unknown identifier error spans and adjusts several Unknown identifier spans to actually end on the identifier in question.


##  Lake[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___21___0-_LPAR_2025-06-30_RPAR_--Lake "Permalink")
  * [#8383](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8383) fixes the use of `import Lake` with precompiled modules, which was previously broken on MacOS.
  * [#8411](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8411) fixes a doc bug in the Resolve.lean; in reverse order, B comes before A
  * [#8528](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8528) fixes the heuristic Lake uses to determine whether a `lean_lib` can be loaded via `lean --plugin` rather than `lean --load-dynlib`. Previously, a mismatch between the single root's name and the library's name would not be caught and cause loading to fail.
  * [#8529](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8529) changes `lake lean` and `lake setup-file` to precompile the imports of non-workspace files using the import's whole library. This ensures that additional link objects are linked and available during elaboration.
  * [#8539](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8539) changes Lake to use relative path for the Lean messages produced by a module build. This makes the message portable across different machines, which is useful for Mathlib's cache.


##  Other[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___21___0-_LPAR_2025-06-30_RPAR_--Other "Permalink")
  * [#8192](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8192) includes upgrades to the `release_checklist.py` script prepared while releasing v4.20.0-rc1.
  * [#8366](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8366) adds the `expose` attribute to `Ordering.then`. This is required for building with the new compiler, but works fine with the old compiler because it silently ignores the missing definition.
