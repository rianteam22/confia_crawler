###  Symbolic Simulation Framework[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--Symbolic-Simulation-Framework "Permalink")
New lightweight symbolic simulation framework integrates with `grind` and enables the implementation of verification condition generators and symbolic execution engines. [#12143](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12143) defines the core API of this framework.

###  User-Defined Grind Attributes[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--User-Defined-Grind-Attributes "Permalink")
[#11765](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11765) implements user-defined `grind` attributes. They are useful for users that want to implement tactics using the `grind` infrastructure (e.g., `progress*` in Aeneas). New `grind` attributes are declared using the command
`register_grind_attr my_grind `
The command is similar to `register_simp_attr`. Recall that similar to `register_simp_attr`, the new attribute cannot be used in the same file it is declared.

```
opaque f : Nat → Nat
opaque g : Nat → Nat

@[my_grind] theorem fax : f (f x) = f x := sorry

example theorem fax2 : f (f (f x)) = f x := by
  fail_if_success grind
  grind [my_grind]

```

[#11770](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11770) implements support for user-defined attributes at `grind_pattern`. After declaring a `grind` attribute with `register_grind_attr my_grind`, one can write:

```
opaque f : Nat → Nat
opaque g : Nat → Nat
axiom fg : g (f x) = x

grind_pattern [my_grind] fg => g (f x)

```

###  Configurable Normalization and Preprocessing in Grind[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--Configurable-Normalization-and-Preprocessing-in-Grind "Permalink")
[#11776](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11776) adds the attributes `[grind norm]` and `[grind unfold]` for controlling the `grind` normalizer and preprocessor.
The `norm` modifier instructs `grind` to use a theorem as a normalization rule. That is, the theorem is applied during the preprocessing step. This feature is meant for advanced users who understand how the preprocessor and `grind`'s search procedure interact with each other. New users can still benefit from this feature by restricting its use to theorems that completely eliminate a symbol from the goal. Example:

```
theorem max_def : max n m = if n ≤ m then m else n

```

The `unfold` modifier instructs `grind` to unfold the given definition during the preprocessing step. Example:
`@[grind unfold] def h (x : [Nat](Basic-Types/Natural-Numbers/#Nat___zero "Documentation for Nat")) := 2 * x example : 6 ∣ 3*[h](releases/v4.28.0/#h "Definition of example") x := byx:[Nat](Basic-Types/Natural-Numbers/#Nat___zero "Documentation for Nat")⊢ 6 [∣](Type-Classes/Basic-Classes/#Dvd___mk "Documentation for Dvd.dvd") 3 [*](Type-Classes/Basic-Classes/#HMul___mk "Documentation for HMul.hMul") [h](releases/v4.28.0/#h "Definition of example") x [grind](Tactic-Proofs/Tactic-Reference/#grind "Documentation for tactic")All goals completed! 🐙 `

###  Local Definitions in Grind and Simp[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--Local-Definitions-in-Grind-and-Simp "Permalink")
[#11946](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11946) adds a `+locals` configuration option to the `grind` tactic that automatically adds all definitions from the current file as e-match theorems. This provides a convenient alternative to manually adding `[local grind]` attributes to each definition. In the form `grind? +locals`, it is also helpful for discovering which local declarations it may be useful to add `[local grind]` attributes to.
[#11947](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11947) adds a `+locals` configuration option to the `simp`, `simp_all`, and `dsimp` tactics.
###  Solver Mode in `bv_decide`[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--Solver-Mode-in--bv_decide "Permalink")
[#11847](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11847) adds a new `solverMode` field to `bv_decide`'s configuration, allowing users to configure the SAT solver for different kinds of workloads. Solver mode can be set to:
  * `proof`, to improve proof search;
  * `counterexample`, to improve counterexample search;
  * `default`, where there are no additional SAT solver flags.


###  Parallel Tactic Combinator[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--Parallel-Tactic-Combinator "Permalink")
[#11949](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11949) adds a new `first_par` tactic combinator that runs multiple tactics in parallel and returns the first successful result (cancelling the others).
The `try?` tactic's `atomicSuggestions` step now uses `first_par` to try three grind variants in parallel:
  * `grind? +suggestions` ̵ uses library suggestion engine
  * `grind? +locals` ̵ unfolds local definitions from current file
  * `grind? +locals +suggestions` ̵ combines both


###  Dependency Management Tools[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--Dependency-Management-Tools "Permalink")
  * [#11726](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11726) upstreams dependency-management commands from Mathlib:
    * `#import_path Foo` prints the transitive import chain that brings `Foo` into scope
    * `assert_not_exists Foo` errors if declaration `Foo` exists (for dependency management)
    * `assert_not_imported Module` warns if `Module` is transitively imported
    * `#check_assertions` verifies all pending assertions are eventually satisfied
  * [#11921](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11921) adds `lake shake` as a built-in Lake command, moving the shake functionality from `script/Shake.lean` into the Lake CLI.


###  External Checker[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--External-Checker "Permalink")
[#11887](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11887) makes the external checker lean4checker available as the existing `leanchecker` binary already known to elan, allowing for out-of-the-box access to it.
###  Library Highlights[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--Library-Highlights "Permalink")
####  Ranges[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--Library-Highlights--Ranges "Permalink")
  * [#11438](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11438) renames the namespace `Std.Range` to `Std.Legacy.Range`. Instead of using `Std.Range` and `[a:b]` notation, the new range type `Std.Rco` and its corresponding `a...b` notation should be used.


####  Iterators[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--Library-Highlights--Iterators "Permalink")
  * [#11446](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11446) moves many constants of the iterator API from `Std.Iterators` to the `Std` namespace in order to make them more convenient to use. These constants include, but are not limited to, `Iter`, `IterM` and `IteratorLoop`. This is a **breaking change**. If something breaks, try adding `open Std` in order to make these constants available again. If some constants in the `Std.Iterators` namespace cannot be found, they can be found directly in `Std` now.
  * [#11789](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11789) makes the `FinitenessRelation` structure, which is helpful when proving the finiteness of iterators, part of the public API.


####  Bitvectors[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--Library-Highlights--Bitvectors "Permalink")
  * [#11257](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11257) adds the definition of `BitVec.cpop`, aka popcount.
  * [#11767](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11767) introduces two induction principles for bitvectors, based on the concat and cons operations.


####  Async Framework[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Highlights--Library-Highlights--Async-Framework "Permalink")
  * [#11499](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11499) adds the `Context` type for cancellation with context propagation. It works by storing a tree of forks of the main context, providing a way to control cancellation.


##  Language[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Language "Permalink")
  * [#11553](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11553) makes `simpH`, used in the match equation generator, produce a proof term. This is in preparation for a bigger refactoring in #11512.
  * [#11666](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11666) makes sure that when a matcher is compiled using a sparse cases, that equation generation also uses sparse cases to split. This fixes #11665.
  * [#11669](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11669) makes sure that proofs about `ctorIdx` passed to `grind` pass the `debug.grind` checks, despite reducing a `semireducible` definition.
  * [#11670](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11670) fixes the `grind` support for `Nat.ctorIdx`. Nat constructors appear in `grind` as offsets or literals, and not as a node marked `.constr`, so handle that case as well.
  * [#11673](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11673) fixes an issue where a `by` in the public scope could create an auxiliary theorem for the proof whose type does not match the expected type in the public scope.
  * [#11698](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11698) makes `mvcgen` early return after simplifying discriminants, avoiding a rewrite on an ill-formed `match`.
  * [#11714](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11714) gives a focused error message when a user tries to name an example, and tweaks error messages for attempts to define multiple opaque names at once.
  * [#11718](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11718) adds a test for issue #11655, which it seems was fixed by #11695
  * [#11721](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11721) improves the performance of the functions for generating congruence lemmas, used by `simp` and a few other components.
  * [#11726](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11726) upstreams dependency-management commands from Mathlib:
    * `#import_path Foo` prints the transitive import chain that brings `Foo` into scope
    * `assert_not_exists Foo` errors if declaration `Foo` exists (for dependency management)
    * `assert_not_imported Module` warns if `Module` is transitively imported
    * `#check_assertions` verifies all pending assertions are eventually satisfied
  * [#11731](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11731) makes the cache in expr _eq_ fn use mimalloc for a small performance win across the board.
  * [#11748](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11748) fixes an edge case where some tactics did not allow access to private declarations inside private proofs under the module system
  * [#11756](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11756) fixes an issue where `grind` fails when trying to unfold a definition by pattern matching imported by `import all` (or from a non-`module`).
  * [#11780](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11780) ensures that pretty-printing of unification hints inserts a space after |- resp. ⊢.
  * [#11871](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11871) makes `mvcgen with tac` fail if `tac` fails on one of the VCs, just as `induction ... with tac` fails if `tac` fails on one of the goals. The old behavior can be recovered by writing `mvcgen with try   tac` instead.
  * [#11875](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11875) adds the directory `Meta/DiscrTree` and reorganizes the code into different files. Motivation: we are going to have new functions for retrieving simplification theorems for the new structural simplifier.
  * [#11882](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11882) adds a guard to `TagDeclarationExtension.tag` to check if the declaration name is anonymous and return early if so. This prevents a panic that could occur when modifiers like `meta` or `noncomputable` are used in combination with syntax errors.
  * [#11896](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11896) fixes a panic that occurred when a theorem had a docstring on an auxiliary definition within a `where` clause.
  * [#11908](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11908) adds two features to the message testing commands: a new `#guard_panic` command that succeeds if the nested command produces a panic message (useful for testing commands expected to panic), and a `substring := true` option for `#guard_msgs` that checks if the docstring appears as a substring of the output rather than requiring an exact match.
  * [#11919](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11919) improves the error message when `initialize` (or `opaque`) fails to find an `Inhabited` or `Nonempty` instance.
  * [#11926](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11926) adds an `unsafe` modifier to an existing helper function user `unsafeEIO`, and also leaves the function private.
  * [#11933](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11933) adds utility functions for managing the message log during tactic evaluation, and refactors existing code to use them.
  * [#11940](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11940) fixes module system visibiltity issues when trying to declare a public inductive inside a mutual block.
  * [#11991](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11991) fixes `declare_syntax_cat` declaring a local category leading to import errors when used in `module` without `public section`.
  * [#12026](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12026) fixes an issue where attributes like `@[irreducible]` would not be allowed under the module system unless combined with `@[exposed]`, but the former may be helpful without the latter to ensure downstream non-`module`s are also affected.
  * [#12045](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12045) disables the `import all` check across package boundaries. Now any module can `import all` any other module.
  * [#12048](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12048) fixes a bug where `mvcgen` loses VCs, resulting in unassigned metavariables. It is fixed by making all emitted VCs synthetic opaque.
  * [#12122](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12122) adds support for Verso docstrings in `where` clauses.
  * [#12148](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12148) reverts #12000, which introduced a regression where `simp` incorrectly rejects valid rewrites for perm lemmas.


##  Library[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Library "Permalink")
  * [#11257](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11257) adds the definition of `BitVec.cpop`, which relies on the more general `BitVec.cpopNatRec`, and build some theory around it. The name `cpop` aligns with the [RISCV ISA nomenclature](https://msyksphinz-self.github.io/riscv-isadoc/#_cpop).
  * [#11438](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11438) renames the namespace `Std.Range` to `Std.Legacy.Range`. Instead of using `Std.Range` and `[a:b]` notation, the new range type `Std.Rco` and its corresponding `a...b` notation should be used. There are also other ranges with open/closed/infinite boundary shapes in `Std.Data.Range.Polymorphic` and the new range notation also works for `Int`, `Int8`, `UInt8`, `Fin` etc.
  * [#11446](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11446) moves many constants of the iterator API from `Std.Iterators` to the `Std` namespace in order to make them more convenient to use. These constants include, but are not limited to, `Iter`, `IterM` and `IteratorLoop`. This is a breaking change. If something breaks, try adding `open Std` in order to make these constants available again. If some constants in the `Std.Iterators` namespace cannot be found, they can be found directly in `Std` now.
  * [#11499](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11499) adds the `Context` type for cancellation with context propagation. It works by storing a tree of forks of the main context, providing a way to control cancellation.
  * [#11532](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11532) adds the new operation `MonadAttach.attach` that attaches a proof that a postcondition holds to the return value of a monadic operation. Most non-CPS monads in the standard library support this operation in a nontrivial way. The PR also changes the `filterMapM`, `mapM` and `flatMapM` combinators so that they attach postconditions to the user-provided monadic functions passed to them. This makes it possible to prove termination for some of these for which it wasn't possible before. Additionally, the PR adds many missing lemmas about `filterMap(M)` and `map(M)` that were needed in the course of this PR.
  * [#11693](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11693) makes it possible to verify loops over iterators. It provides MPL spec lemmas about `for` loops over pure iterators. It also provides spec lemmas that rewrite loops over `mapM`, `filterMapM` or `filterM` iterator combinators into loops over their base iterator.
  * [#11705](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11705) provides many lemmas about `Int` ranges, in analogy to those about `Nat` ranges. A few necessary basic `Int` lemmas are added. The PR also removes `simp` annotations on `Rcc.toList_eq_toList_rco`, `Nat.toList_rcc_eq_toList_rco` and consorts.
  * [#11706](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11706) removes the `IteratorCollect` type class and hereby simplifies the iterator API. Its limited advantages did not justify the complexity cost.
  * [#11710](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11710) extends the get-elem tactic for ranges so that it supports subarrays. Example:

```
example {a : Array Nat} (h : a.size = 28) : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  for h : i in *...(3 : Nat) do
    x := a[1...4][i]

```

  * [#11716](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11716) adds more MPL spec lemmas for all combinations of `for` loops, `fold(M)` and the `filter(M)/filterMap(M)/map(M)` iterator combinators. These kinds of loops over these combinators (e.g. `it.mapM`) are first transformed into loops over their base iterators (`it`), and if the base iterator is of type `Iter _` or `IterM Id _`, then another spec lemma exists for proving Hoare triples about it using an invariant and the underlying list (`it.toList`). The PR also fixes a bug that MPL always assigns the default priority to spec lemmas if `Std.Tactic.Do.Syntax` is not imported and a bug that low-priority lemmas are preferred about high-priority ones.
  * [#11724](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11724) adds more `event_loop_lock`s to fix race conditions.
  * [#11728](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11728) introduces some additional lemmas around `BitVec.extractLsb'` and `BitVec.extractLsb`.
  * [#11760](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11760) allows `grind` to use `List.eq_nil_of_length_eq_zero` (and `Array.eq_empty_of_size_eq_zero`), but only when it has already proved the length is zero.
  * [#11761](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11761) adds some `grind_pattern` `guard` conditions to potentially expensive theorems.
  * [#11762](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11762) moves the grind pattern from `Sublist.eq_of_length` to the slightly more general `Sublist.eq_of_length_le`, and adds a grind pattern guard so it only activates if we have a proof of the hypothesis.
  * [#11767](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11767) introduces two induction principles for bitvectors, based on the concat and cons operations. We show how this principle can be useful to reason about bitvectors by refactoring two population count lemmas (`cpopNatRec_zero_le` and `toNat_cpop_append`) and introducing a new lemma (`toNat_cpop_not`). To use the induction principle we also move `cpopNatRec_cons_of_le` and `cpopNatRec_cons_of_lt` earlier in the popcount section (they are the building blocks enabling us to take advantage of the new induction principle).
  * [#11772](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11772) fixes a bug in the optimized and unsafe implementation of `Array.foldlM`.
  * [#11774](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11774) fixes a mismatch between the behavior of `foldlM` and `foldlMUnsafe` in the three array types. This mismatch is only exposed when manually specifying a `stop` value greater than the size of the array and only exploitable through `native_decide`.
  * [#11779](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11779) fixes an oversight in the initial #11772 PR.
  * [#11784](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11784) just adds an optional start position argument to `PersistentArray.forM`
  * [#11789](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11789) makes the `FinitenessRelation` structure, which is helpful when proving the finiteness of iterators, part of the public API. Previously, it was marked internal and experimental.
  * [#11794](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11794) implements the function `getMaxFVar?` for implementing `SymM` primitives.
  * [#11834](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11834) adds `num?` parameter to `mkPatternFromTheorem` to control how many leading quantifiers are stripped when creating a pattern. This enables matching theorems where only some quantifiers should be converted to pattern variables.
  * [#11848](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11848) fixes a bug at `Name.beq` reported by gasstationcodemanager@gmail.com
  * [#11852](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11852) changes the definition of the iterator combinators `takeWhileM` and `dropWhileM` so that they use `MonadAttach`. This is only relevant in rare cases, but makes it sometimes possible to prove such combinators finite when the finiteness depends on properties of the monadic predicate.
  * [#11901](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11901) adds `gcd_left_comm` lemmas for both `Nat` and `Int`:
    * `Nat.gcd_left_comm`: `gcd m (gcd n k) = gcd n (gcd m k)`
    * `Int.gcd_left_comm`: `gcd a (gcd b c) = gcd b (gcd a c)`
  * [#11905](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11905) provides a `Decidable` instance for `Nat.isPowerOfTwo` based on the formula `(n ≠ 0) ∧ (n &&& (n - 1)) = 0`.
  * [#11907](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11907) implements `PersistentHashMap.findKeyD` and `PersistentHashSet.findD`. The motivation is avoid two memory allocations (`Prod.mk` and `Option.some`) when the collections contains the key.
  * [#11945](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11945) changes the runtime implementation of the `Decidable (xs = #[])` and `Decidable (#[] = xs)` instances to use `Array.isEmpty`. Previously, `decide (xs = #[])` would first convert `xs` into a list and then compare it against `List.nil`.
  * [#11979](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11979) adds `suggest_for` annotations such that `Int*.toNatClamp` is suggested for `Int*.toNat`.
  * [#11989](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11989) removes a leftover `example` from `src/Std/Tactic/BVDecide/Bitblast/BVExpr/Circuit/Lemmas/Operations/Clz.lean`.
  * [#11993](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11993) adds `grind` annotations to the lemmas about `Subarray` and `ListSlice`.
  * [#12058](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12058) implements iteration over ranges for `Fin` and `Char`.
  * [#12139](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12139) adds `«term_⁻¹»` to the `recommended_spelling` for `inv`, matching the pattern used by all other operators which include both the function and the syntax in their spelling lists.


##  Tactics[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Tactics "Permalink")
  * [#11664](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11664) adds support for `Nat.cast` in `grind linarith`. It now uses `Grind.OrderedRing.natCast_nonneg`. Example:

```
open Lean Grind Std
attribute [instance] Semiring.natCast

variable [Lean.Grind.CommRing R] [LE R] [LT R] [LawfulOrderLT R] [IsLinearOrder R] [OrderedRing R]

example (a : Nat) : 0 ≤ (a : R) := by grind
example (a b : Nat) : 0 ≤ (a : R) + (b : R) := by grind

```

  * [#11677](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11677) adds basic support for equality propagation in `grind linarith` for the `IntModule` case. This covers only the basic case. See note in the code. We remark this feature is irrelevant for `CommRing` since `grind ring` already has much better support for equality propagation.
  * [#11678](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11678) fixes a bug in `registerNonlinearOccsAt` used to implement `grind lia`. This issue was originally reported at: https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/113489-new-members/topic/Weirdness.20with.20cutsat/near/562099515
  * [#11691](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11691) fixes `grind` to support dot notation on declarations in the lemma list.
  * [#11700](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11700) adds a link to the `grind` docstring. The link directs users to the section describing `grind` in the reference manual.
  * [#11712](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11712) avoids invoking TC synthesis and other inference mechanisms in the simprocs of `bv_decide`. This can give significant speedups on problems that pressure these simprocs.
  * [#11717](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11717) improves the performance of `bv_decide`'s rewriter on large problems.
  * [#11736](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11736) fixes an issue where `exact?` would not suggest private declarations defined in the current module.
  * [#11739](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11739) turns even more commonly used `bv_decide` theorems that require unification into fast simprocs using syntactic equality. This pushes the overall performance across sage/app7 to <= 1min10s for every problem.
  * [#11749](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11749) fixes a bug in the function `selectNextSplit?` used in `grind`. It was incorrectly computing the generation of each candidate.
  * [#11758](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11758) improves support for nonstandard `Int`/`Nat` instances in `grind` and `simp +arith`.
  * [#11765](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11765) implements user-defined `grind` attributes. They are useful for users that want to implement tactics using the `grind` infrastructure (e.g., `progress*` in Aeneas). New `grind` attributes are declared using the command

```
register_grind_attr my_grind

```

The command is similar to `register_simp_attr`. Recall that similar to `register_simp_attr`, the new attribute cannot be used in the same file it is declared.

```
opaque f : Nat → Nat
opaque g : Nat → Nat

@[my_grind] theorem fax : f (f x) = f x := sorry

example theorem fax2 : f (f (f x)) = f x := by
  fail_if_success grind
  grind [my_grind]

```

  * [#11769](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11769) uses the new support for user-defined `grind` attributes to implement the default `[grind]` attribute.
  * [#11770](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11770) implements support for user-defined attributes at `grind_pattern`. After declaring a `grind` attribute with `register_grind_attr my_grind`, one can write:

```
grind_pattern [my_grind] fg => g (f x)

```

  * [#11776](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11776) adds the attributes `[grind norm]` and `[grind unfold]` for controlling the `grind` normalizer/preprocessor.
  * [#11785](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11785) disables closed term extraction in the reflection terms used by `bv_decide`. These terms do not profit at all from closed term extraction but can in practice cause thousands of new closed term declarations which in turn slows down the compiler.
  * [#11787](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11787) adds support for incrementally processing local declarations in `grind`. Instead of processing all hypotheses at once during goal initialization, `grind` now tracks which local declarations have been processed via `Goal.nextDeclIdx` and provides APIs to process new hypotheses incrementally. This feature will be used by the new `SymM` monad for efficient symbolic simulation.
  * [#11788](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11788) introduces `SymM`, a new monad for implementing symbolic simulators (e.g., verification condition generators) in Lean. The monad addresses performance issues found in symbolic simulators built on top of user-facing tactics like `apply` and `intros`.
  * [#11792](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11792) adds `isDebugEnabled` for checking whether `grind.debug` is set to `true` when `grind` was initialized.
  * [#11793](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11793) adds functions for creating maximally shared terms from maximally shared terms. It is more efficient than creating an expression and then invoking `shareCommon`. We are going to use these functions for implementing the symbolic simulation primitives.
  * [#11797](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11797) simplifies `AlphaShareCommon.State` by separating the persistent and transient parts of the state.
  * [#11800](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11800) adds the function `Sym.replaceS`, which is similar to `replace_fn` available in the kernel but assumes the input is maximally shared and ensures the output is also maximally shared. The PR also generalizes the `AlphaShareBuilder` API.
  * [#11802](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11802) adds the function `Sym.instantiateS` and its variants, which are similar to `Expr.instantiate` but assumes the input is maximally shared and ensures the output is also maximally shared.
  * [#11803](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11803) implements `intro` (and its variants) for `SymM`. These versions do not use reduction or infer types, and ensure expressions are maximally shared.
  * [#11806](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11806) refactors the `Goal` type used in `grind`. The new representation allows multiple goals with different metavariables to share the same `GoalState`. This is useful for automation such as symbolic simulator, where applying theorems create multiple goals that inherit the same E-graph, congruence closure and solvers state, and other accumulated facts.
  * [#11810](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11810) adds a new transparency mode `.none` in which no definitions are unfolded.
  * [#11813](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11813) introduces a fast pattern matching and unification module for the symbolic simulation framework (`Sym`). The design prioritizes performance by using a two-phase approach:
**Phase 1 (Syntactic Matching)**
    * Patterns use de Bruijn indices for expression variables and renamed level params (`_uvar.0`, `_uvar.1`, ...) for universe variables
    * Matching is purely structural after reducible definitions are unfolded during preprocessing
    * Universe levels treat `max` and `imax` as uninterpreted functions (no AC reasoning)
    * Binders and term metavariables are deferred to Phase 2
**Phase 2 (Pending Constraints)**
    * Handles binders (Miller patterns) and metavariable unification
    * Converts remaining de Bruijn variables to metavariables
    * Falls back to `isDefEq` when necessary
  * [#11814](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11814) implements `instantiateRevBetaS`, which is similar to `instantiateRevS` but beta-reduces nested applications whose function becomes a lambda after substitution.
  * [#11815](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11815) optimizes pattern matching by skipping proof and instance arguments during Phase 1 (syntactic matching).
  * [#11819](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11819) adds some basic infrastructure for a structural (and cheaper) `isDefEq` predicate for pattern matching and unification in `Sym`.
  * [#11820](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11820) adds optimized `abstractFVars` and `abstractFVarsRange` for converting free variables to de Bruijn indices during pattern matching/unification.
  * [#11824](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11824) implements `isDefEqS`, a lightweight structural definitional equality for the symbolic simulation framework. Unlike the full `isDefEq`, it avoids expensive operations while still supporting Miller pattern unification.
  * [#11825](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11825) completes the new pattern matching and unification procedures for the symbolic simulation framework using a two-phase approach.
  * [#11833](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11833) fixes a few typos, adds missing docstrings, and adds a (simple) missing optimization.
  * [#11837](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11837) adds `BackwardRule` for efficient goal transformation via backward chaining in `SymM`.
  * [#11847](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11847) adds a new `solverMode` field to `bv_decide`'s configuration, allowing users to configure the SAT solver for different kinds of workloads.
  * [#11849](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11849) fixes missing zetaDelta support at the pattern matching/unification procedure in the new Sym framework.
  * [#11850](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11850) fixes a bug in the new pattern matching procedure for the Sym framework. It was not correctly handling assigned metavariables during pattern matching.
  * [#11851](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11851) fixes `Sym/Intro.lean` support for `have`-declarations.
  * [#11856](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11856) adds the basic infrastructure for the structural simplifier used by the symbolic simulation (`Sym`) framework.
  * [#11857](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11857) adds an incremental variant of `shareCommon` for expressions constructed from already-shared subterms. We use this when an expression `e` was produced by a Lean API (e.g., `inferType`, `mkApp4`) that does not preserve maximal sharing, but the inputs to that API were already maximally shared. Unlike `shareCommon`, this function does not use a local `Std.HashMap ExprPtr Expr` to track visited nodes. This is more efficient when the number of new (unshared) nodes is small, which is the common case when wrapping API calls that build a few constructor nodes around shared inputs.
  * [#11858](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11858) changes `bv_decide`'s heuristic for what kinds of structures to split on to also allow splitting on structures where the fields have dependently typed widths. For example:

```
structure Byte (w : Nat) where
  /-- A two's complement integer value of width `w`. -/
  val : BitVec w
  /-- A per-bit poison mask of width `w`. -/
  poison : BitVec w

```

This is to allow handling situations such as `(x : Byte 8)` where the width becomes concrete after splitting is done.
  * [#11860](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11860) adds `CongrInfo` analysis for function applications in the symbolic simulator framework. `CongrInfo` determines how to build congruence proofs for rewriting subterms efficiently, categorizing functions into:
    * `none`: no arguments can be rewritten (e.g., proofs)
    * `fixedPrefix`: common case where implicit/instance arguments form a fixed prefix and explicit arguments can be rewritten (e.g., `HAdd.hAdd`, `Eq`)
    * `interlaced`: rewritable and non-rewritable arguments alternate (e.g., `HEq`)
    * `congrTheorem`: uses auto-generated congruence theorems for functions with dependent proof arguments (e.g., `Array.eraseIdx`)
  * [#11866](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11866) implements the core simplification loop for the `Sym` framework, with efficient congruence-based argument rewriting.
  * [#11868](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11868) implements `Sym.Simp.Theorem.rewrite?` for rewriting terms using equational theorems in `Sym`.
  * [#11869](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11869) adds configuration flag `Meta.Context.cacheInferType`. You can use it to disable the `inferType` cache at `MetaM`. We use this flag to implement `SymM` because it has its own cache based on pointer equality.
  * [#11878](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11878) documents assumptions made by the symbolic simulation framework regarding structural matching and definitional equality.
  * [#11880](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11880) adds a `with_unfolding_none` tactic that sets the transparency mode to `.none`, in which no definitions are unfolded. This complements the existing `with_unfolding_all` tactic and provides tactic-level access to the `TransparencyMode.none` added in https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11810.
  * [#11881](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11881) fixes an issue where `grind` failed to prove `f ≠ 0` from `f * r   ≠ 0` when using `Lean.Grind.CommSemiring`, but succeeded with `Lean.Grind.Semiring`.
  * [#11884](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11884) adds discrimination tree support for the symbolic simulation framework. The new `DiscrTree.lean` module converts `Pattern` values into discrimination tree keys, treating proof/instance arguments and pattern variables as wildcards (`Key.star`). Motivation: efficient pattern retrieval during rewriting.
  * [#11886](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11886) adds `getMatch` and `getMatchWithExtra` for retrieving patterns from discrimination trees in the symbolic simulation framework. The PR also adds uses `DiscrTree` to implement indexing in `Sym.simp`.
  * [#11888](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11888) refactors `Sym.simp` to make it more general and customizable. It also moves the code to its own subdirectory `Meta/Sym/Simp`.
  * [#11889](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11889) improves the discrimination tree retrieval performance used by `Sym.simp`.
  * [#11890](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11890) ensures that `Sym.simp` checks thresholds for maximum recursion depth and maximum number of steps. It also invokes `checkSystem`. Additionally, this PR simplifies the main loop. Assigned metavariables and `zetaDelta` reduction are now handled by installing `pre`/`post` methods.
  * [#11892](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11892) optimizes the construction on congruence proofs in `simp`. It uses some of the ideas used in `Sym.simp`.
  * [#11898](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11898) adds support for simplifying lambda expressions in `Sym.simp`. It is much more efficient than standard simp for very large lambda expressions with many binders. The key idea is to generate a custom function extensionality theorem for the type of the lambda being simplified.
  * [#11900](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11900) adds a `done` flag to the result returned by `Simproc`s in `Sym.simp`.
  * [#11906](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11906) tries to minimize the number of expressions created at `AlphaShareCommon`.
  * [#11909](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11909) reorganizes the monad hierarchy for symbolic computation in Lean.
  * [#11911](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11911) minimizes the number of expression allocations performed by `replaceS` and `instantiateRevBetaS`.
  * [#11914](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11914) factors out the `have`-telescope support used in `simp`, and implements it using the `MonadSimp` interface. The goal is to use this nice infrastructure for both `Meta.simp` and `Sym.simp`.
  * [#11918](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11918) filters deprecated lemmas from `exact?` and `rw?` suggestions.
  * [#11920](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11920) implements support for simplifying `have` telescopes in `Sym.simp`.
  * [#11923](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11923) adds a new option to the function `simpHaveTelescope` in which the `have` telescope is simplified in two passes:
    * In the first pass, only the values and the body are simplified.
    * In the second pass, unused declarations are eliminated.
  * [#11932](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11932) eliminates super-linear kernel type checking overhead when simplifying lambda expressions. I improved the proof term produced by `mkFunext`. This function is used in `Sym.simp` when simplifying lambda expressions.
  * [#11946](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11946) adds a `+locals` configuration option to the `grind` tactic that automatically adds all definitions from the current file as e-match theorems. This provides a convenient alternative to manually adding `[local grind]` attributes to each definition. In the form `grind?   +locals`, it is also helpful for discovering which local declarations it may be useful to add `[local grind]` attributes to.
  * [#11947](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11947) adds a `+locals` configuration option to the `simp`, `simp_all`, and `dsimp` tactics that automatically adds all definitions from the current file to unfold.
  * [#11949](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11949) adds a new `first_par` tactic combinator that runs multiple tactics in parallel and returns the first successful result (cancelling the others).
  * [#11950](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11950) implements `simpForall` and `simpArrow` in `Sym.simp`.
  * [#11962](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11962) fixes library suggestions to include private proof-valued structure fields.
  * [#11967](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11967) implements a new strategy for simplifying `have`-telescopes in `Sym.simp` that achieves linear kernel type-checking time instead of quadratic.
  * [#11974](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11974) optimizes congruence proof construction in `Sym.simp` by avoiding `inferType` calls on expressions that are less likely to be cached. Instead of inferring types of expressions like `@HAdd.hAdd Nat Nat Nat instAdd 5`, we infer the type of the function prefix `@HAdd.hAdd Nat Nat Nat instAdd` and traverse the forall telescope.
  * [#11976](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11976) adds missing type checking for pattern variables during pattern matching/unification to prevent incorrect matches.
  * [#11985](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11985) implements support for auto-generated congruence theorems in `Sym.simp`, enabling simplification of functions with complex argument dependencies such as proof arguments and `Decidable` instances.
  * [#11999](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11999) adds support for simplifying the arguments of over-applied and under-applied function application terms in `Sym.simp`, completing the implementation for all three congruence strategies (fixed prefix, interlaced, and congruence theorems).
  * [#12006](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12006) fixes the pretty-printing of the `extract_lets` tactic. Previously, the pretty-printer would expect a space after the `extract_lets` tactic, when it was followed by another tactic on the same line: for example, `extract_lets; exact foo` would be changed to `extract_lets ; exact foo`.
  * [#12012](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12012) implements support for rewrite on over-applied terms in `Sym.simp`. Example: rewriting `id f a` using `id_eq`.
  * [#12031](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12031) adds `Sym.Simp.evalGround`, a simplification procedure for evaluating ground terms of builtin numeric types. It is designed for `Sym.simp`.
  * [#12032](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12032) adds `Discharger`s to `Sym.simp`, and ensures the cached results are consistent.
  * [#12033](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12033) adds support for conditional rewriting rules to `Sym.simp`.
  * [#12035](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12035) adds `simpControl`, a simproc that handles control-flow expressions such as `if-then-else`. It simplifies conditions while avoiding unnecessary work on branches that won't be taken.
  * [#12039](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12039) implements `match`-expression simplification for `Sym.simp`.
  * [#12040](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12040) adds simprocs for simplifying `cond` and dependent `if-then-else` in `Sym.simp`.
  * [#12053](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12053) adds support for offset terms in `SymM`. This is essential for handling equational theorems for functions that pattern match on natural numbers in `Sym.simp`. Without this, it cannot handle simple examples such as `pw (a + 2)` where `pw` pattern matches on `n+1`.
  * [#12077](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12077) implements simprocs for `String` and `Char`. It also ensures reducible definitions are unfolded in `SymM`
  * [#12096](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12096) cleanups temporary metavariables generated when applying rewriting rules in `Sym.simp`.
  * [#12099](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12099) ensures `Sym.simpGoal` does not use `mkAppM`. It also increases the default number of maximum steps in `Sym.simp`.
  * [#12100](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12100) adds a comparison between `MetaM` and `SymM` for a benchmark was proposed during the Lean@Google Hackathon.
  * [#12101](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12101) improves the the `Sym.simp` APIs. It is now easier to reuse the simplifier cache between different simplification steps. We use the APIs to improve the benchmark at #12100.
  * [#12134](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12134) adds a new benchmark `shallow_add_sub_cancel.lean` that demonstrates symbolic simulation using a shallow embedding into monadic `do` notation, as opposed to the deep embedding approach in `add_sub_cancel.lean`.
  * [#12143](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12143) adds an API for building symbolic simulation engines and verification condition generators that leverage `grind`. The API wraps `Sym` operations to work with `grind`'s `Goal` type, enabling lightweight symbolic execution while carrying `grind` state for discharge steps.
  * [#12145](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12145) moves the pre-shared commonly used expressions from `GrindM` to `SymM`.
  * [#12147](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12147) adds a new API for helping users write focused rewrites.


##  Compiler[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Compiler "Permalink")
  * [#11479](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11479) enables the specializer to also recursively specialize in some non trivial higher order situations.
  * [#11729](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11729) internalizes all arguments of Quot.lift during LCNF conversion, preventing panics in certain non trivial programs that use quotients.
  * [#11874](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11874) improves the performance of `getLine` by coalescing the locking of the underlying `FILE*`.
  * [#11916](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11916) adds a symbol to the runtime for marking `Array` non-linearities. This should allow users to spot them more easily in profiles or hunt them down using a debugger.
  * [#11983](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11983) fixes the `floatLetIn` pass to not move variables in case it could break linearity (owned variables being passed with RC 1). This mostly improves the situation in the parser which previously had many functions that were supposed to be linear in terms of `ParserState` but the compiler made them non-linear. For an example of how this affected parsers:

```
def optionalFn (p : ParserFn) : ParserFn := fun c s =>
  let iniSz  := s.stackSize
  let iniPos := s.pos
  let s      := p c s
  let s      := if s.hasError && s.pos == iniPos then s.restore iniSz iniPos else s
  s.mkNode nullKind iniSz

```

previously moved the `let iniSz := ...` declaration into the `hasError` branch. However, this means that at the point of calling the inner parser (`p c s`), the original state `s` needs to have RC>1 because it is used later in the `hasError` branch, breaking linearity. This fix prevents such moves, keeping `iniSz` before the `p c s` call.
  * [#12003](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12003) splits up the SCC that the compiler manages into (potentially) multiple ones after performing lambda lifting. This aids both the closed term extractor and the elimDeadBranches pass as they are both negatively influenced when more declarations than required are within one SCC.
  * [#12008](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12008) ensures that the LCNF simplifier already constant folds decision procedures (`Decidable` operations) in the base phase.
  * [#12010](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12010) fixe a superliniear behavior in the closed subterm extractor.
  * [#12123](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12123) fixes an issue that may sporadically trigger ASAN to got into a deadlock when running a subprocess through the `IO.Process.spawn` framework.

  * [#11737](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11737) replaces `ffi.md` with links to the corresponding sections of the manual, so we don't have to keep two documents up to date.
  * [#11912](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11912) adds missing docstrings for parts of the iterator library, which removes warnings and empty content in the manual.
  * [#12047](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12047) makes the automatic first token detection in tactic docs much more robust, in addition to making it work in modules and other contexts where builtin tactics are not in the environment. It also adds the ability to override the tactic's first token as the user-visible name.
  * [#12072](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12072) enables tactic completion and docs for the `let rec` tactic, which required a stage0 update after #12047.
  * [#12093](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12093) makes the Verso module docstring API more like the Markdown module docstring API, enabling downstream consumers to use them the same way.


##  Server[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Server "Permalink")
  * [#11536](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11536) corrects the JSON Schema at `src/lake/schemas/lakefile-toml-schema.json` to allow the table variant of the `require.git` field in `lakefile.toml` as specified in the [reference](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/Build-Tools-and-Distribution/Lake/#Lake___Dependency-git).
  * [#11630](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11630) improves the performance of autocompletion and fuzzy matching by introducing an ASCII fast path into one of their core loops and making Char.toLower/toUpper more efficient.
  * [#12000](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12000) fixes an issue where go-to-definition would jump to the wrong location in presence of async theorems.
  * [#12004](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12004) allows 'Go to Definition' to look through reducible definition when looking for typeclass instance projections.
  * [#12046](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12046) fixes a bug where the unknown identifier code actions were broken in NeoVim due to the language server not properly setting the `data?` field for all code action items that it yields.
  * [#12119](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12119) fixes the call hierarchy for `where` declarations under the module system


##  Lake[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___28___0-_LPAR_2026-02-17_RPAR_--Lake "Permalink")
  * [#11683](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11683) fixes an inconsistency in the way Lake and Lean view the transitivity of a `meta import`. Lake now works as Lean expects and includes the meta segment of all transitive imports of a `meta import` in its transitive trace.
  * [#11859](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11859) removes the need to write `.ofNat` for numeric options in `lakefile.lean`. Note that `lake translate-config` incorrectly assumed this was already legal in earlier revisions.
  * [#11921](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11921) adds `lake shake` as a built-in Lake command, moving the shake functionality from `script/Shake.lean` into the Lake CLI.
  * [#12034](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12034) changes the default of `enableArtifactCache` to use the workspace's `enableArtifactCache` setting if the package is a dependency and `LAKE_ARTIFACT_CACHE` is not set. This means that dependencies of a project with `enableArtifactCache` set will also, by default, use Lake's local artifact cache.
  * [#12037](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12037) fixes two Lake cache issues: a bug where a failed upload would not produce an error and a mistake in the `--wfail` checks of the cache commands.
  * [#12076](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12076) adds additional debugging information to a run of `lake build   --no-build` via a `.nobuild` trace file. When a build fails due to needing a rebuild, Lake emits the new expected trace next as `.nobuild` file next to the build's old `.trace`. The inputs recorded in these files can then be compared to debug what caused the mismatch.
  * [#12086](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12086) fixes a bug where a `lake build --no-build` would exit with code `3` if the optional job to fetch a GitHub or Reservoir release for a package failed (even if nothing else needed rebuilding).
  * [#12105](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12105) fixes the `lake query` output for targets which produce an `Array` or `List` of a value with a custom `QueryText` or `QueryJson` instance (e.g., `deps` and `transDeps`).
  * [#12112](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12112) revives the ability to specify modules in dependencies via the basic `+mod` target key.

  * [#11727](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11727) adds a Python script that helps find which commit introduced a behavior change in Lean. It supports multiple bisection modes and automatically downloads CI artifacts when available.
  * [#11735](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11735) adds a standalone script to download pre-built CI artifacts from GitHub Actions. This allows us to quickly switch commits without rebuilding.
  * [#11887](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11887) makes the external checker lean4checker available as the existing `leanchecker` binary already known to elan, allowing for out-of-the-box access to it.
  * [#12121](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12121) wraps info trees produced by the `lean` Verso docstring codeblock in a context info node.
