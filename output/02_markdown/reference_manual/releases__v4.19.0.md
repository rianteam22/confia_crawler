###  New Decorations in VS Code[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Highlights--New-Decorations-in-VS-Code "Permalink")
Visual feedback in VS Code has been improved, with the extension now featuring:
  * Gutter decorations for errors and warnings. These make the full range of errors/warnings clear, which is especially useful when the corresponding squigglies are small.
  * End-of-line markers for 'unsolved goals'. These are displayed at the line where 'unsolved goals' error ends and indicate where the proof needs to be continued.
  * 'Goals accomplished!' message. When a theorem or a `Prop`-typed `example` contains no errors or `sorry`s anymore, two blue checkmarks appear next to the start of the declaration as a gutter decoration. Additionally, a 'Goals accomplished!' message appears under 'Messages' in the InfoView.


Gutter decorations for errors and warnings are available for all Lean 4 versions. Decorations for 'unsolved goals' and 'goals accomplished' rely on server-side support, which is added in this version via [#7366](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7366).
All of these features can be disabled, and 'Goals accomplished!' icon can be configured in VS Code extension settings. See [leanprover/vscode-lean4#585](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/pull/585) for the details.
###  Parallel Elaboration[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Highlights--Parallel-Elaboration "Permalink")
  * [#7084](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7084) enables the elaboration of theorem bodies, i.e. proofs, to happen in parallel to each other as well as to other elaboration tasks.


###  Language Features[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Highlights--Language-Features "Permalink")
  * [#5182](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5182) makes functions defined by well-founded recursion use an `opaque` well-founded proof by default. This reliably prevents kernel reduction of such definitions and proofs, which tends to be prohibitively slow (fixes [#2171](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/2171)), and which regularly causes hard-to-debug kernel type-checking failures. This change renders `unseal` ineffective for such definitions. To avoid the opaque proof, annotate the function definition with `@[semireducible]`.
  * [#7166](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7166) extends the notion of “fixed parameter” of a recursive function also to parameters that come after varying function. The main benefit is that we get nicer induction principles.
Before, the definition

```
def app (as : List α) (bs : List α) : List α :=
  match as with
  | [] => bs
  | a::as => a :: app as bs

```

produced

```
app.induct.{u_1} {α : Type u_1} (motive : List α → List α → Prop) (case1 : ∀ (bs : List α), motive [] bs)
  (case2 : ∀ (bs : List α) (a : α) (as : List α), motive as bs → motive (a :: as) bs) (as bs : List α) : motive as bs

```

and now you get

```
app.induct.{u_1} {α : Type u_1} (motive : List α → Prop) (case1 : motive [])
  (case2 : ∀ (a : α) (as : List α), motive as → motive (a :: as)) (as : List α) : motive as

```

because `bs` is fixed throughout the recursion (and can completely be dropped from the principle).
This is a **breaking change** when such an induction principle is used explicitly. Using `fun_induction` makes proof tactics robust against this change.
See the PR description for the rules for when a parameter is considered fixed.
Note that in a definition like

```
def app : List α → List α → List α
  | [], bs => bs
  | a::as, bs => a :: app as bs

```

the `bs` is not considered fixed, as it goes through the matcher machinery.
  * [#7431](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7431) changes the syntax of location modifiers for tactics like `simp` and `rw` (e.g., `simp at h ⊢`) to allow the turnstile `⊢` to appear anywhere in the sequence of locations.
  * [#7457](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7457) ensures info tree users such as linters and request handlers have access to info subtrees created by async elab task by introducing API to leave holes filled by such tasks.
**Breaking change** : other metaprogramming users of `Command.State.infoState` may need to call `InfoState.substituteLazy` on it manually to fill all holes.


###  Updates to structures and classes[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Highlights--Updates-to-structures-and-classes "Permalink")
  * [#7302](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7302) changes how fields are elaborated in the `structure`/`class` commands and also makes default values respect the structure resolution order when there is diamond inheritance. Before, the details of subobjects were exposed during elaboration, and in the local context any fields that came from a subobject were defined to be projections of the subobject field. Now, every field is represented as a local variable. All parents (not just subobject parents) are now represented in the local context, and they are now local variables defined to be parent constructors applied to field variables (inverting the previous relationship). See the PR description for further details.
  * [#7640](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7640) implements the main logic for inheriting and overriding autoParam fields in the `structure`/`class` commands, pending being enabled in the structure instance notation elaborator. Adds term info to overridden fields, so they now can be hovered over, and "go to definition" goes to the structure the field is originally defined in.
  * [#7717](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7717) changes how `{...}`/`where` notation ("structure instance notation") elaborates. The notation now tries to simulate a flat representation as much as possible, without exposing the details of subobjects. This is a **breaking change** , see the PR description for further details and mitigation strategies.
  * [#7742](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7742) adds a feature to `structure`/`class` where binders without types on a field definition are interpreted as overriding the type's parameters binder kinds in that field's projection function. See the PR description for further details.


###  Library Updates[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Highlights--Library-Updates "Permalink")
  * Developments in the async machinery;
  * Standardization of the integer division API;
  * Conversions between finite types;
  * API expansion of `BitVec` and tree maps;
  * Proofs of Bitwuzla rewrite rules;
  * Improvements to `List`/`Array`/`Vector`, as well as `HashMap` and `Int`/`Nat`.


See the Library section below for details.
###  Other Highlights[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Highlights--Other-Highlights "Permalink")
  * Documentation has been significantly expanded. See the Documentation section below for details.
  * [#7185](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7185) refactors Lake's build internals to enable the introduction of targets and facets beyond packages, modules, and libraries. Facets, build keys, build info, and CLI commands have been generalized to arbitrary target types.


##  Language[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Language "Permalink")
  * [#5182](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5182) makes functions defined by well-founded recursion use an `opaque` well-founded proof by default; see highlights section for details.
  * [#5998](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5998) lets `omega` always abstract its own proofs into an auxiliary definition. The size of the olean of Vector.Extract goes down from 20MB to 5MB with this, overall stdlib olean size and build instruction count go down 5%.
  * [#6325](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/6325) ensures that environments can be loaded, repeatedly, without executing arbitrary code
  * [#7075](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7075) ensures that names suggested by tactics like `simp?` are not shadowed by auxiliary declarations in the local context and that names of `let rec` and `where` declarations are correctly resolved in tactic blocks.
  * [#7166](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7166) extends the notion of “fixed parameter” of a recursive function also to parameters that come after varying function; see highlights section for details.
  * [#7256](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7256) introduces the `assert!` variant `debug_assert!` that is activated when compiled with `buildType` `debug`.
  * [#7304](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7304) fixes an issue where nested `let rec` declarations within `match` expressions or tactic blocks failed to compile if they were nested within, and recursively called, a `let rec` that referenced a variable bound by a containing declaration.
  * [#7324](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7324) changes the internal construction of well-founded recursion, to not change the type of `fix`’s induction hypothesis in non-defeq ways.
  * [#7333](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7333) allows aux decls (like generated by `match`) to be generated by decreasing_by tactics.
  * [#7335](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7335) modifies `elabTerminationByHints` in a way that the type of the recursive function used for elaboration of the termination measure is striped of from optional parameters. It prevents introducing dependencies between the default values for arguments, that can cause the termination checker to fail.
  * [#7353](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7353) changes `abstractNestedProofs` so that it also visits the subterms in the head of an application.
  * [#7362](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7362) allows simp dischargers to add aux decls to the environment. This enables tactics like `native_decide` to be used here, and unblocks improvements to omega in #5998.
  * [#7387](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7387) uses `-implicitDefEqProofs` in `bv_omega` to ensure it is not affected by the change in #7386.
  * [#7397](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7397) ensures that `Poly.mul p 0` always returns `Poly.num 0`.
  * [#7409](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7409) allows the use of `dsimp` during preprocessing of well-founded definitions. This fixes regressions when using `if-then-else` without giving a name to the condition, but where the condition is needed for the termination proof, in cases where that subexpression is reachable only by dsimp, but not by simp (e.g. inside a dependent let)
  * [#7431](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7431) changes the syntax of location modifiers for tactics like `simp` and `rw` (e.g., `simp at h ⊢`) to allow the turnstile `⊢` to appear anywhere in the sequence of locations.
  * [#7509](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7509) disables the `implicitDefEqProofs` simp option in the preprocessor of `bv_decide` in order to account for regressions caused by #7387.
  * [#7511](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7511) fixes two bugs in `simp +arith` that were preventing specific subterms from being normalized.
  * [#7515](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7515) fixes another bug in `simp +arith`. This bug was affecting `grind`. See new test for an example.
  * [#7551](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7551) changes `isNatCmp` to ignore optional arguments annotations, when checking for `<`-like comparison between elements of `Nat`. That previously caused `guessLex` to fail when checking termination of a function, whose signature involved an optional argument of the type `Nat`.
  * [#7560](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7560) ensures that we use the same ordering to normalize linear `Int` terms and relations. This change affects `simp +arith` and `grind` normalizer.
  * [#7622](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7622) fixes `fun_induction` when used on structurally recursive functions where there are targets occurring before fixed parameters.
  * [#7630](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7630) fixes a performance issue in the `whnfCore` procedure.
  * [#7728](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7728) fixes an issue in `abstractNestedProofs`. We should abstract proofs occurring in the inferred proposition too.


###  Structures[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Language--Structures "Permalink")
  * [#7302](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7302) changes how fields are elaborated in the `structure`/`class` commands and also makes default values respect the structure resolution order when there is diamond inheritance. Before, the details of subobjects were exposed during elaboration, and in the local context any fields that came from a subobject were defined to be projections of the subobject field. Now, every field is represented as a local variable. All parents (not just subobject parents) are now represented in the local context, and they are now local variables defined to be parent constructors applied to field variables (inverting the previous relationship). Other notes:
    * The entire collection of parents is processed, and all parent projection names are checked for consistency. Every parent appears in the local context now.
    * For classes, every parent now contributes an instance, not just the parents represented as subobjects.
    * Default values are now processed according to the parent resolution order. Default value definition/override auxiliary definitions are stored at `StructName.fieldName._default`, and inherited values are stored at `StructName.fieldName._inherited_default`. Metaprograms no longer need to look at parents when doing calculations on default values.
    * Default value omission for structure instance notation pretty printing has been updated in consideration of this.
    * Now the elaborator generates a `_flat_ctor` constructor that will be used for structure instance elaboration. All types in this constructor are put in "field normal form" (projections of parent constructors are reduced, and parent constructors are eta reduced), and all fields with autoParams are annotated as such. This is not meant for users, but it may be useful for metaprogramming.
    * While elaborating fields, any metavariables whose type is one of the parents is assigned to that parent. The hypothesis is that, for the purpose of elaborating structure fields, parents are fixed: there is only _one_ instance of any given parent under consideration. See the `Magma` test for an example of this being necessary. The hypothesis may not be true when there are recursive structures, since different values of the structure might not agree on parent fields.
  * [#7314](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7314) changes elaboration of `structure` parents so that each must be fully elaborated before the next one is processed.
  * [#7640](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7640) implements the main logic for inheriting and overriding autoParam fields in the `structure`/`class` commands, pending being enabled in the structure instance notation elaborator. Adds term info to overridden fields, so they now can be hovered over, and "go to definition" goes to the structure the field is originally defined in.
  * [#7652](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7652) gives `#print` for structures the ability to show the default values and auto-param tactics for fields.
  * [#7717](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7717) changes how `{...}`/`where` notation ("structure instance notation") elaborates. The notation now tries to simulate a flat representation as much as possible, without exposing the details of subobjects. Features:
    * When fields are elaborated, their expected types now have a couple reductions applied. For all projections and constructors associated to the structure and its parents, projections of constructors are reduced and constructors of projections are eta reduced, and also implementation detail local variables are zeta reduced in propositions (so tactic proofs should never see them anymore). Furthermore, field values are beta reduced automatically in successive field types. The example in [mathlib4#12129](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/12129#issuecomment-2056134533) now shows a goal of `0 = 0` rather than `{ toFun := fun x => x }.toFun 0 = 0`.
    * All parents can now be used as field names, not just the subobject parents. These are like additional sources but with three constraints: every field of the value must be used, the fields must not overlap with other provided fields, and every field of the specified parent must be provided for. Similar to sources, the values are hoisted to `let`s if they are not already variables, to avoid multiple evaluation. They are implementation detail local variables, so they get unfolded for successive fields.
    * All class parents are now used to fill in missing fields, not just the subobject parents. Closes #6046. Rules: (1) only those parents whose fields are a subset of the remaining fields are considered, (2) parents are considered only before any fields are elaborated, and (3) only those parents whose type can be computed are considered (this can happen if a parent depends on another parent, which is possible since #7302).
    * Default values and autoparams now respect the resolution order completely: each field has at most one default value definition that can provide for it. The algorithm that tries to unstick default values by walking up the subobject hierarchy has been removed. If there are applications of default value priorities, we might consider it in a future release.
    * The resulting constructors are now fully packed. This is implemented by doing structure eta reduction of the elaborated expressions.
    * "Magic field definitions" (as reported [on Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/113489-new-members/topic/Where.20is.20sSup.20defined.20on.20submodules.3F/near/499578795)) have been eliminated. This was where fields were being solved for by unification, tricking the default value system into thinking they had actually been provided. Now the default value system keeps track of which fields it has actually solved for, and which fields the user did not provide. Explicit structure fields (the default kind) without any explicit value definition will result in an error. If it was solved for by unification, the error message will include the inferred value, like "field 'f' must be explicitly provided, its synthesized value is v"
    * When the notation is used in patterns, it now no longer inserts fields using class parents, and it no longer applies autoparams or default values. The motivation is that one expects patterns to match only the given fields. This is still imperfect, since fields might be solved for indirectly.
    * Elaboration now attempts error recovery. Extraneous fields log errors and are ignored, missing fields are filled with `sorry`.
  * [#7742](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7742) adds a feature to `structure`/`class` where binders without types on a field definition are interpreted as overriding the type's parameters binder kinds in that field's projection function. The rules are (1) only a prefix of the binders are interpreted this way, (2) multi-identifier binders are allowed but they must all be for parameters, (3) only parameters that appear in the declaration itself (not from `variables`) can be overridden and (4) the updates will be applied after parameter binder kind inference is done. Binder updates are not allowed in default value redefinitions. Example application: In the following, `(R p)` causes the `R` and `p` parameters to be explicit, where normally they would be implicit.

```
class CharP (R : Type u) [AddMonoidWithOne R] (p : Nat) : Prop where
  cast_eq_zero_iff (R p) : ∀ x : Nat, (x : R) = 0 ↔ p ∣ x

#guard_msgs in #check CharP.cast_eq_zero_iff
/-
info: CharP.cast_eq_zero_iff.{u} (R : Type u) {inst✝ : AddMonoidWithOne R} (p : Nat) [self : CharP R p] (x : Nat) :
  ↑x = 0 ↔ p ∣ x
-/

```

  * [#7746](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7746) adds declaration ranges to structure fields that were copied from parents that aren't represented as subobjects, supporting "go to definition". The declaration range is the parent in the `extends` clause.


###  Parallel Elaboration[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Language--Parallel-Elaboration "Permalink")
  * [#7084](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7084) enables the elaboration of theorem bodies, i.e. proofs, to happen in parallel to each other as well as to other elaboration tasks.
  * [#7247](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7247) makes generation of `match` equations and splitters compatible with parallelism.
  * [#7261](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7261) ensures all equation, unfold, induction, and partial fixpoint theorem generators in core are compatible with parallelism.
  * [#7348](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7348) ensures all equation and unfold theorem generators in core are compatible with parallelism.
  * [#7457](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7457) ensures info tree users such as linters and request handlers have access to info subtrees created by async elab task by introducing API to leave holes filled by such tasks.
  * [#8101](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/8101) fixes a parallelism regression where linters that e.g. check for errors in the command would no longer find such messages.


###  bv_decide[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Language--bv_decide "Permalink")
  * [#7298](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7298) adds rewrites to bv_decide's preprocessing that concern combinations of if-then-else and operation such as multiplication or negation.
  * [#7309](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7309) fixes a bug where bv_decide's new structure support would sometimes not case split on all available structure fvars as their type was an mvar.
  * [#7329](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7329) adds support to bv_decide for simple pattern matching on enum inductives. By simple we mean non dependent match statements with all arms written out.
  * [#7347](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7347) upgrades the CaDiCal we ship and use for bv_decide to version 2.1.2. Additionally it enables binary LRAT proofs on windows by default as https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical/issues/112 has been fixed.
  * [#7381](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7381) refactors the AIG datastructures that underly bv_decide in order to allow a better tracking of negations in the circuit. This refactor has two effects, for one adding full constant folding to the AIG framework and secondly enabling us to add further simplifications from the Brummayer Biere paper in the future which was previously architecturally impossible.
  * [#7390](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7390) makes bv_decide's preprocessing handle casts, as we are in the constant BitVec fragment we should be able to always remove them using BitVec.cast_eq.
  * [#7407](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7407) adds rules for `-1#w * a = -a` and `a * -1#w = -a` to bv_normalize as seen in Bitwuzla's BV_MUL_SPECIAL_CONST.
  * [#7417](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7417) adds support for enum inductive matches with default branches to bv_decide.
  * [#7429](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7429) adds the BV_EXTRACT_FULL preprocessing rule from Bitwuzla to bv_decide.
  * [#7436](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7436) adds simprocs that turn left and right shifts by constants into extracts to bv_decide.
  * [#7438](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7438) adds the EQUAL_CONST_BV_ADD and BV_AND_CONST rules to bv_decide's preprocessor.
  * [#7441](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7441) adds the BV_CONCAT_CONST, BV_CONCAT_EXTRACT and ELIM_ZERO_EXTEND rule from Bitwuzla to bv_decide.
  * [#7477](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7477) ensures that bv_decide doesn't accidentally operate on terms underneath binders. As there is currently no binder construct that is in the supported fragment of bv_decide this changes nothing about the proof power.
  * [#7480](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7480) adds the necessary rewrites for the Bitwuzla rules BV_ULT_SPECIAL_CONST, BV_SIGN_EXTEND_ELIM, TODO.
  * [#7486](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7486) adds the BitVec.add_neg_mul rule introduced in #7481 to bv_decide's preprocessor.
  * [#7491](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7491) achieves a speed up in bv_decide's LRAT checker by improving its input validation.
  * [#7521](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7521) adds the equivalent of `Array.emptyWithCapacity` to the AIG framework and applies it to `bv_decide`. This is particularly useful as we are only working with capacities that are always known at run time so we should never have to reallocate a `RefVec`.
  * [#7527](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7527) adds the BV_EXTRACT_CONCAT_LHS_RHS, NORM_BV_ADD_MUL and NORM_BV_SHL_NEG rewrite from Bitwuzla as well as a reduction from getLsbD to extractLsb' to bv_decide.
  * [#7615](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7615) adds the ADD part of bitwuzlas BV_EXTRACT_ADD_MUL rule to bv_decide's preprocessor.
  * [#7617](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7617) adds the known bits optimization from the multiplication circuit to the add one, allowing us to discover potentially even more symmetries before going to the SAT solver.
  * [#7636](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7636) makes sure that the expression level cache in bv_decide is maintained across the entire bitblaster instead of just locally per BitVec expression.
  * [#7644](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7644) adds a cache to the reflection procedure of bv_decide.
  * [#7649](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7649) changes the AIG representation of constants from `const (b : Bool)` to a single constructor `false`. Since #7381 `Ref` contains an `invert` flag meaning the constant `true` can be represented as a `Ref` to `false` with `invert` set, so no expressivity is lost.
  * [#7655](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7655) adds the preprocessing rule for extraction over multiplication to bv_decide.
  * [#7663](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7663) uses computed fields to store the hash code and pointer equality to increase performance of comparison and hashmap lookups on the core data structure used by the bitblaster.
  * [#7670](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7670) improves the caching computation of the atoms assignment in bv_decide's reflection procedure.
  * [#7698](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7698) adds more sharing and caching procedures to bv_decide's reflection step.
  * [#7720](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7720) compresses the AIG representation by storing the inverter bit in the lowest bit of the gate descriptor instead of as a separate `Bool`.
  * [#7727](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7727) avoids some unnecessary allocations in the CNF to dimacs conversion
  * [#7733](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7733) ensures that in the AIG the constant circuit node is always stored at the first spot. This allows us to skip performing a cache lookup when we require a constant node.


###  Grind[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Language--Grind "Permalink")
  * [#7355](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7355) fixes a bug in the `markNestedProofs` preprocessor used in the `grind` tactic.
  * [#7392](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7392) fixes an issue in the `grind` tactic when case splitting on if-then-else expressions.
  * [#7510](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7510) ensures that `grind` can be used as a more powerful `contradiction` tactic, sparing the user from having to type `exfalso; grind` or `intros; exfalso; grind`.
  * [#7512](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7512) adds missing normalization rules for `Nat` div and mod to the `grind` tactic.
  * [#7514](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7514) adds more missing normalization rules for `div` and `mod` to `grind`.
  * [#7532](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7532) fixes the procedure for putting new facts into the `grind` "to-do" list. It ensures the new facts are preprocessed. also removes some of the clutter in the `Nat.sub` support.
  * [#7540](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7540) adds `[grind cases eager]` attribute to `Subtype`. See new test.
  * [#7553](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7553) removes a bad normalization rule in `grind`, and adds a missing dsimproc.
  * [#7641](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7641) implements basic model-based theory combination in `grind`. `grind` can now solve examples such as

```
example (f : Int → Int) (x : Int)
    : 0 ≤ x → x ≠ 0 → x ≤ 1 → f x = 2 → f 1 = 2 := by
  grind

```

  * [#7712](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7712) ensures `grind` always abstract its own proofs into an auxiliary definition/theorem. This is similar to #5998 but for `grind`
  * [#7714](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7714) fixes an assertion violation in the `grind` model-based theory combination module.
  * [#7723](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7723) adds the configuration options `zeta` and `zetaDelta` in `grind`. Both are set to `true` by default.
  * [#7724](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7724) adds `dite_eq_ite` normalization rule to `grind`. This rule is important to adjust mismatches between a definition and its function induction principle.
  * [#7726](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7726) fixes the `markNestedProofs` procedure used in `grind`. It was missing the case where the type of a nested proof may contain other nested proofs.
  * [#7760](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7760) ensures `grind` is using the default transparency setting when computing auxiliary congruence lemmas.
  * [#7765](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7765) improves how `grind` normalizes dependent implications during introduction. Previously, `grind` would introduce a hypothesis `h : p` for a goal of the form `.. ⊢ (h : p) → q h`, and then normalize and assert a non-dependent copy of `p`. As a result, the local context would contain both `h : p` and a separate `h' : p'`, where `p'` is the normal form of `p`. Moreover, `q` would still depend on the original `h`.
  * [#7776](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7776) improves the equality proof discharger used by the E-matching procedure in `grind`.
  * [#7777](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7777) fixes the introduction procedure used in `grind`. It was not registering local instances that are also propositions. See new test.
  * [#7778](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7778) adds missing propagation rules for `LawfulBEq A` to `grind`. They are needed in a context where the instance `DecidableEq A` is not available. See new test.
  * [#7781](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7781) adds a new propagation rule for `Bool` disequalities to `grind`. It now propagates `x = true` (`x = false`) from the disequality `x = false` (`x = true`). It ensures we don't have to perform case analysis on `x` to learn this fact. See tests.


###  CutSat[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Language--CutSat "Permalink")
  * [#7312](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7312) implements proof term generation for `cooper_dvd_left` and its variants in the cutsat procedure for linear integer arithmetic.
  * [#7315](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7315) implements the Cooper conflict resolution in cutsat. We still need to implement the backtracking and disequality case.
  * [#7339](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7339) implements cooper conflict resolution in the cutsat procedure. It also fixes several bugs in the proof term construction. We still need to add more tests, but we can already solve the following example that `omega` fails to solve:

```
example (x y : Int) :
    27 ≤ 11*x + 13*y →
    11*x + 13*y ≤ 45 →
    -10 ≤ 7*x - 9*y →
    7*x - 9*y ≤ 4 → False := by
  grind

```

  * [#7351](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7351) ensures cutsat does not have to perform case analysis in the univariate polynomial case. That it, it can close a goal whenever there is no solution for a divisibility constraint in an interval. Example of theorem that is now proved in a single step by cutsat:

```
example (x : Int) : 100 ≤ x → x ≤ 10000 → 20000 ∣ 3*x → False := by
  grind

```

  * [#7357](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7357) adds support for `/` and `%` to the cutsat procedure.
  * [#7369](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7369) uses `let`-declarations for each polynomial occurring in a proof term generated by the cutsat procedure.
  * [#7370](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7370) simplifies the proof term due to the Cooper's conflict resolution in cutsat.
  * [#7373](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7373) implements the last missing case for the cutsat procedure and fixes a bug. During model construction, we may encounter a bounded interval containing integer solutions that satisfy the divisibility constraint but fail to satisfy known disequalities.
  * [#7394](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7394) adds infrastructure necessary for supporting `Nat` in the cutsat procedure. It also makes the `grind` more robust.
  * [#7396](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7396) fixes a bug in the cutsat model construction. It was searching for a solution in the wrong direction.
  * [#7401](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7401) improves the cutsat model search procedure by tightening inequalities using divisibility constraints.
  * [#7494](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7494) implements support for `Nat` inequalities in the cutsat procedure.
  * [#7495](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7495) implements support for `Nat` divisibility constraints in the cutsat procedure.
  * [#7501](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7501) implements support for `Nat` equalities and disequalities in the cutsat procedure.
  * [#7502](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7502) implements support for `Nat` div and mod in the cutsat procedure.
  * [#7503](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7503) implements support for `Nat.sub` in cutsat
  * [#7536](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7536) implements support for `¬ d ∣ p` in the cutsat procedure.
  * [#7537](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7537) implements support for `Int.natAbs` and `Int.toNat` in the cutsat procedure.
  * [#7538](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7538) fixes a bug in the cutsat model construction. It was not resetting the decision stack at the end of the search.
  * [#7561](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7561) fixes the support for nonlinear `Nat` terms in cutsat. For example, cutsat was failing in the following example

```
example (i j k l : Nat) : i / j + k + l - k = i / j + l := by grind

```

because we were not adding the fact that `i / j` is non negative when we inject the `Nat` expression into `Int`.
  * [#7579](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7579) improves the counterexamples produced by the cutsat procedure, and adds proper support for `Nat`. Before this PR, the assignment for an natural variable `x` would be represented as `NatCast.natCast x`.


##  Library[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Library "Permalink")
  * [#6496](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/6496) adds short-circuit support to bv_decide to accelerate multiplications with shared coefficients. In particular, `a * x = b * x` can be extended to `a = b v (a * x = b * x)`. The latter is faster if `a = b` is true, as `a = b` may be evaluated without considering the multiplication circuit. On the other hand, we require the multiplication circuit, as `a * x = b * x -> a = b` is not always true due to two's complement wrapping.
  * [#7141](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7141) generalizes `cond` to allow the motive to be in `Sort u`, not just `Type u`.
  * [#7289](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7289) adds `getKey_beq`, `getKey_congr` and variants to the hashmap api.
  * [#7319](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7319) continues alignment of lemmas about `Int.ediv/fdiv/tdiv`, including adding notes about "missing" lemmas that do not apply in one case. Also lemmas about `emod/fmod/tmod`. There's still more to do.
  * [#7338](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7338) adds @[simp] to `Int.neg_inj`.
  * [#7341](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7341) adds an equivalence relation to the hash map with several lemmas for it.
  * [#7356](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7356) adds lemmas reducing monadic operations with `pure` to the non-monadic counterparts.
  * [#7358](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7358) fills further gaps in the integer division API, and mostly achieves parity between the three variants of integer division. There are still some inequality lemmas about `tdiv` and `fdiv` that are missing, but as they would have quite awkward statements I'm hoping that for now no one is going to miss them.
  * [#7378](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7378) adds lemmas about `Int` that will be required in #7368.
  * [#7380](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7380) moves `DHashMap.Raw.foldRev(M)` into `DHashMap.Raw.Internal`.
  * [#7406](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7406) makes the instance for `Subsingleton (Squash α)` work for `α : Sort u`.
  * [#7418](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7418) renames several hash map lemmas (`get` -> `getElem`) and uses `m[k]?` instead of `get? m k` (and also for `get!` and `get`).
  * [#7432](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7432) adds a consequence of `Nat.add_div` using a divisibility hypothesis.
  * [#7433](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7433) makes `simp` able to simplify basic `for` loops in monads other than `Id`.
  * [#7435](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7435) reviews the `Nat` and `Int` API, making the interfaces more consistent.
  * [#7445](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7445) renames `Array.mkEmpty` to `emptyWithCapacity`. (Similarly for `ByteArray` and `FloatArray`.)
  * [#7446](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7446) prefers using `∅` instead of `.empty` functions. We may later rename `.empty` functions to avoid the naming clash with `EmptyCollection`, and to better express semantics of functions which take an optional capacity argument.
  * [#7451](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7451) renames the member `insert_emptyc_eq` of the `LawfulSingleton` type class to `insert_empty_eq` to conform to the recommended spelling of `∅` as `empty`.
  * [#7466](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7466) further cleans up simp lemmas for `Int`.
  * [#7516](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7516) changes the order of arguments for `List.modify` and `List.insertIdx`, making them consistent with `Array`.
  * [#7522](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7522) splits off the required theory about `Nat`, `Fin` and `BitVec` from #7484.
  * [#7529](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7529) upstreams `bind_congr` from Mathlib and proves that the minimum of a sorted list is its head and weakens the antisymmetry condition of `min?_eq_some_iff`. Instead of requiring an `Std.Antisymm` instance, `min?_eq_some_iff` now only expects a proof that the relation is antisymmetric _on the elements of the list_. If the new premise is left out, an autoparam will try to derive it from `Std.Antisymm`, so existing usages of the theorem will most likely continue to work.
  * [#7541](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7541) corrects names of a number of lemmas, where the incorrect name was identified automatically by a [tool](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/270676-lean4/topic/automatic.20spelling.20generation.20.26.20comparison/near/505760384) written by @Rob23oba.
  * [#7554](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7554) adds SMT-LIB operators to detect overflow `BitVec.negOverflow`, according to the [SMTLIB standard](https://github.com/SMT-LIB/SMT-LIB-2/blob/2.7/Theories/FixedSizeBitVectors.smt2), and the theorem proving equivalence of such definition with the `BitVec` library functions (`negOverflow_eq`).
  * [#7558](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7558) changes the definition of `Nat.div` and `Nat.mod` to use a structurally recursive, fuel-based implementation rather than well-founded recursion. This leads to more predictable reduction behavior in the kernel.
  * [#7565](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7565) adds `BitVec.toInt_sdiv` plus a lot of related bitvector theory around divisions.
  * [#7614](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7614) marks `Nat.div` and `Nat.modCore` as `irreducible`, to recover the behavior from before #7558.
  * [#7672](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7672) reviews the implicitness of arguments across List/Array/Vector, generally trying to make arguments implicit where possible, although sometimes correcting propositional arguments which were incorrectly implicit to explicit.
  * [#7687](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7687) provides `Inhabited`, `Ord` (if missing), `TransOrd`, `LawfulEqOrd` and `LawfulBEqOrd` instances for various types, namely `Bool`, `String`, `Nat`, `Int`, `UIntX`, `Option`, `Prod` and date/time types. It also adds a few related theorems, especially about how the `Ord` instance for `Int` relates to `LE` and `LT`.
  * [#7692](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7692) upstreams a small number of ordering lemmas for `Fin` from mathlib.
  * [#7700](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7700) provides `Ord`-related instances such as `TransOrd` for `IntX`, `Ordering`, `BitVec`, `Array`, `List` and `Vector`.
  * [#7704](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7704) adds lemmas about the modulo operation defined on signed bounded integers.
  * [#7706](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7706) performs various cleanup tasks on `Init/Data/UInt/*` and `Init/Data/SInt/*`.
  * [#7729](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7729) replaces `assert!` with `assertBEq` to fix issues where asserts didn't trigger the `ctest` due to being in a separate task. This was caused by panics not being caught in tasks, while IO errors were handled by the `AsyncTask` if we use the `block` function on them.
  * [#7756](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7756) adds lemmas about `Nat.gcd` (some of which are currently present in mathlib).
**BREAKING CHANGE:** While many lemmas were renamed and the lemma with the old signature was simply deprecated, some lemmas were changed without renaming them. They now use the `getElem` variants instead of `get`.

    * More than 1 repetition to require exactly that many characters
  * [#7574](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7574) introduces UDP socket support using the LibUV library, enabling asynchronous I/O operations with it.

  * [#7584](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7584) introduces a structure called `FormatConfig`, which provides additional configuration options for `GenericFormat`, such as whether leap seconds should be allowed during parsing. By default, this option is set to `false`.
  * [#7751](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7751) adds `Std.BaseMutex.tryLock` and `Std.Mutex.tryAtomically` as well as unit tests for our locking and condition variable primitives.

Additionally, it generalizes the `fold*`/`keys` lemmas to arbitrary tree maps, which were previously stated only for the `DTreeMap α Unit` case.
  * [#7331](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7331) provides lemmas about the tree map function `insertMany` and its interaction with other functions for which lemmas already exist. Most lemmas about `ofList`, which is related to `insertMany`, are not included.

  * [#7367](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7367) provides lemmas for the tree map functions `alter` and `modify` and their interactions with other functions for which lemmas already exist.
**BREAKING CHANGE:** The signature of `size_alter` was corrected for all four hash map types. Instead of relying on the boolean operations `contains` and `&&` in the if statements, we now use the `Prop`-based operations `Membership` and `And`.

  * [#7674](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7674) add missing lemmas about the tree map: `minKey*` variants return the head of `keys`, `keys` and `toList` are ordered and `getKey* t.minKey?` equals the minimum.
  * [#7675](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7675) provides lemmas about the tree map function `maxKeyD` and its interactions with other functions for which lemmas already exist.

While at it, we also add `toInt_zero_length` and `toInt_of_zero_length`. In support of our main theorem we add `toInt_shiftRight_lt` and `le_toInt_shiftRight`, which make the main theorem automatically derivable via omega.
  * [#7225](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7225) contains `BitVec.(toInt, toFin)_twoPow` theorems, completing the API for `BitVec.*_twoPow`. It also expands the `toNat_twoPow` API with `toNat_twoPow_of_le`, `toNat_twoPow_of_lt`, as well as `toNat_twoPow_eq_if` and moves `msb_twoPow` up, as it is used in the `toInt_msb` proof.
  * [#7415](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7415) adds a few lemmas about the interactions of `BitVec` with `Fin` and `Nat`.
  * [#7420](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7420) generalizes `BitVec.toInt_[lt|le]'` to not require `0 < w`.
  * [#7465](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7465) adds the theorem:

```
theorem lt_allOnes_iff {x : BitVec w} : x < allOnes w ↔ x ≠ allOnes w

```

to simplify comparisons against `-1#w`. This is a corollary of the existing lemma:

```
theorem allOnes_le_iff {x : BitVec w} : allOnes w ≤ x ↔ x = allOnes w

```

  * [#7599](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7599) adds SMT-LIB operators to detect overflow `BitVec.(usubOverflow, ssubOverflow)`, according to the [SMTLIB standard](https://github.com/SMT-LIB/SMT-LIB-2/blob/2.7/Theories/FixedSizeBitVectors.smt2), and the theorems proving equivalence of such definition with the `BitVec` library functions `BittVec.(usubOverflow_eq, ssubOverflow_eq)`.
  * [#7604](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7604) adds bitvector theorems that to push negation into other operations, following Hacker's Delight: Ch2.1.
  * [#7605](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7605) adds theorems `BitVec.[(toInt, toFin)_(extractLsb, extractLsb')]`, completing the API for `BitVec.(extractLsb, extractLsb')`.
  * [#7616](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7616) introduces `BitVec.(toInt, toFin)_rotate(Left, Right)`, completing the API for `BitVec.rotate(Left, Right)`
  * [#7658](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7658) introduces `BitVec.(toFin_signExtend_of_le, toFin_signExtend)`, completing the API for `BitVec.signExtend`.
  * [#7661](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7661) adds theorems `BitVec.[(toFin, toInt)_setWidth', msb_setWidth'_of_lt, toNat_lt_twoPow_of_le, toInt_setWidth'_of_lt]`, completing the API for `BitVec.setWidth'`.
  * [#7699](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7699) adds the `BitVec.toInt_srem` lemma, relating `BitVec.srem` with `Int.tmod`.


###  Bitwuzla Rewrite Rules[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Library--Bitwuzla-Rewrite-Rules "Permalink")
  * [#7424](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7424) proves Bitwuzla's rule [`BV_ZERO_EXTEND_ELIM`](https://github.com/bitwuzla/bitwuzla/blob/6a1a768987cca77f36ebfe06f3a786348a481bbd/src/rewrite/rewrites_bv.cpp#L4021-L4033):

```
theorem setWidth_eq_append {v : Nat} {x : BitVec v} {w : Nat} (h : v ≤ w) :
    x.setWidth w = ((0#(w - v)) ++ x).cast (by omega) := by

```

  * [#7426](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7426) adds the Bitwuzla rewrite rule [`BV_EXTRACT_FULL`](https://github.com/bitwuzla/bitwuzla/blob/6a1a768987cca77f36ebfe06f3a786348a481bbd/src/rewrite/rewrites_bv.cpp#L1236-L1253), which is useful for the bitblaster to simplify `extractLsb'` based expressions.
  * [#7427](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7427) implements the bitwuzla rule [`BV_CONCAT_EXTRACT`](https://github.com/bitwuzla/bitwuzla/blob/main/src/rewrite/rewrites_bv.cpp#L1146-L1176). This will be used by the bitblaster to simplify adjacent `extract`s into a single `extract`.
  * [#7454](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7454) implements the bitwuzla rule [BV_SIGN_EXTEND_ELIM](https://github.com/bitwuzla/bitwuzla/blob/main/src/rewrite/rewrites_bv.cpp#L3638-L3663), which rewrites a `signExtend x` as an `append` of the appropriate sign bits, followed by the bits of `x`.
  * [#7461](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7461) introduces a bitvector associativity/commutativity normalization on bitvector terms of the form `(a * b) = (c * d)` for `a, b, c, d` bitvectors. This mirrors Bitwuzla's `PassNormalize::process`'s `PassNormalize::normalize_eq_add_mul`.
  * [#7481](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7481) implements the Bitwuzla rewrites [BV_ADD_NEG_MUL](./../../), and associated lemmas to make the proof streamlined. `bvneg (bvadd a (bvmul a b)) = (bvmul a (bvnot b))`, or spelled as lean:

```
theorem neg_add_mul_eq_mul_not {x y : BitVec w} :
    - (x + x * y) = (x * ~~~ y)

```

  * [#7482](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7482) implements the [BV_EXTRACT_CONCAT](https://github.com/bitwuzla/bitwuzla/blob/6a1a768987cca77f36ebfe06f3a786348a481bbd/src/rewrite/rewrites_bv.cpp#L1264) rule from Bitwuzla, which explains how to extract bits from an append. We first prove a 'master theorem' which has the full case analysis, from which we rapidly derive the necessary `BV_EXTRACT_CONCAT` theorems:

```
theorem extractLsb'_append_eq_ite {v w} {xhi : BitVec v} {xlo : BitVec w} {start len : Nat} :
    extractLsb' start len (xhi ++ xlo) =
    if hstart : start < w
    then
      if hlen : start + len < w
      then extractLsb' start len xlo
      else
        (((extractLsb' (start - w) (len - (w - start)) xhi) ++
            extractLsb' start (w - start) xlo)).cast (by omega)
    else
      extractLsb' (start - w) len xhi


```

  * [#7493](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7493) implements the Bitwuzla rewrite rule [NORM_BV_ADD_MUL](https://github.com/bitwuzla/bitwuzla/blob/e09c50818b798f990bd84bf61174553fef46d561/src/rewrite/rewrites_bv_norm.cpp#L19-L23), and the associated lemmas to allow for expedient rewriting:

```
theorem neg_add_mul_eq_mul_not {x y : BitVec w} : - (x + x * y) = x * ~~~ y

```

  * [#7508](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7508) shows that negation commutes with left shift, which is the Bitwuzla rewrite [NORM_BV_SHL_NEG](https://github.com/bitwuzla/bitwuzla/blob/e09c50818b798f990bd84bf61174553fef46d561/src/rewrite/rewrites_bv_norm.cpp#L142-L148).
  * [#7594](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7594) implements the Bitwuzla rewrites [BV_EXTRACT_ADD_MUL](https://github.com/bitwuzla/bitwuzla/blob/e09c50818b798f990bd84bf61174553fef46d561/src/rewrite/rewrites_bv.cpp#L1495-L1510), which witness that the high bits at `i >= len` do not affect the bits of the product upto `len`.
  * [#7595](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7595) implements the addition rewrite from the Bitwuzla rewrite [BV_EXTRACT_ADD_MUL](https://github.com/bitwuzla/bitwuzla/blob/e09c50818b798f990bd84bf61174553fef46d561/src/rewrite/rewrites_bv.cpp#L1495-L1510), which witness that the high bits at `i >= len` do not affect the bits of the sum upto `len`:

```
theorem extractLsb'_add {w len} {x y : BitVec w} (hlen : len ≤ w) :
    (x + y).extractLsb' 0 len = x.extractLsb' 0 len + y.extractLsb' 0 len

```

  * [#7757](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7757) adds the Bitwuzla rewrite `NORM_BV_ADD_CONCAT` for symbolic simplification of add-of-append.


##  Compiler[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Compiler "Permalink")
  * [#7398](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7398) fixes a scoping error in the cce (Common Case Elimination) pass of the old code generator. This pass would create a join point for common minor premises even if some of those premises were in the bodies of locally defined functions, which results in an improperly scoped reference to a join point. The fix is to save/restore candidates when visiting a lambda.
  * [#7710](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7710) improves memory use of Lean, especially for longer-running server processes, by up to 60%


##  Pretty Printing[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Pretty-Printing "Permalink")
  * [#7589](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7589) changes the structure instance notation pretty printer so that fields are omitted if their value is definitionally equal to the default value for the field (up to reducible transparency). Setting `pp.structureInstances.defaults` to true forces such fields to be pretty printed anyway.


##  Documentation[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Documentation "Permalink")

##  Server[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Server "Permalink")
  * [#7178](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7178) fixes a race condition in the language server that would sometimes cause it to drop requests and never respond to them when editing the header of a file. This in turn could cause semantic highlighting to stop functioning in VS Code, as VS Code would stop emitting requests when a prior request was dropped, and also cause the InfoView to become defective. It would also cause import auto-completion to feel a bit wonky, since these requests were sometimes dropped. This race condition has been present in the language server since its first version in 2020.
  * [#7223](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7223) implements parallel watchdog request processing so that requests that are processed by the watchdog cannot block the main thread of the watchdog anymore.
  * [#7240](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7240) adds a canonical syntax for linking to sections in the language reference along with formatting of examples in docstrings according to the docstring style guide.
  * [#7343](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7343) mitigates an issue where inserting an inlay hint in VS Code by double-clicking would insert the inlay hint at the wrong position right after an edit.
  * [#7344](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7344) combines the auto-implicit inlay hint tooltips into a single tooltip. This works around an issue in VS Code where VS Code fails to update hovers for tooltips in adjacent inlay hint parts when moving the mouse.
  * [#7346](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7346) fixes an issue where the language server would run into an inlay hint assertion violation when deleting a file that is still open in the language server.
  * [#7366](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7366) adds server-side support for dedicated 'unsolved goals' and 'goals accomplished' diagnostics that will have special support in the Lean 4 VS Code extension. The special 'unsolved goals' diagnostic is adapted from the 'unsolved goals' error diagnostic, while the 'goals accomplished' diagnostic is issued when a `theorem` or `Prop`-typed `example` has no errors or `sorry`s. The Lean 4 VS Code extension companion PR is at leanprover/vscode-lean4#585.
  * [#7376](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7376) ensures `weak` options do not have to be repeated in both Lake `leanOptions` and `moreServerOptions`.
  * [#7882](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7882) fixes a regression where elaboration of a previous document version is not cancelled on changes to the document.


##  Lake[🔗](find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___19___0-_LPAR_2025-05-01_RPAR_--Lake "Permalink")
  * [#7185](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7185) refactors Lake's build internals to enable the introduction of targets and facets beyond packages, modules, and libraries. Facets, build keys, build info, and CLI commands have been generalized to arbitrary target types.
  * [#7393](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7393) adds autocompletion support for Lake configuration fields in the Lean DSL at the indented whitespace after an existing field. Autocompletion in the absence of any fields is currently still not supported.
**Breaking change:** The nonstandard braced configuration syntax now uses a semicolon `;` rather than a comma `,` as a separator. Indentation can still be used as an alternative to the separator.
  * [#7399](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7399) reverts the new builtin initializers, elaborators, and macros in Lake back to non-builtin.
  * [#7504](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7504) augments the Lake configuration data structures declarations (e.g., `PackageConfig`, `LeanLibConfig`) to produce additional metadata which is used to automatically generate the Lean & TOML encoders and decoders via metaprograms.
  * [#7543](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7543) unifies the configuration declarations of dynamic targets, external libraries, Lean libraries, and Lean executables into a single data type stored in a unified map within a package.
**Breaking change:** Users can no longer define multiple targets with the same name but different kinds (e.g., a Lean executable and a Lean library both named `foo`). This should not effect most users as the Lake DSL already discouraged this.
  * [#7576](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7576) changes Lake to produce and use response files on Windows when building executables and libraries (static and shared). This is done to avoid potentially exceeding Windows command line length limits.
  * [#7586](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7586) changes the `static.export` facet for Lean libraries to produce thin static libraries.
  * [#7608](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7608) removes the use of the Lake plugin in the Lake build and in configuration files.
  * [#7667](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7667) changes Lake to log messages from a Lean configuration the same way it logs message from a Lean build. This, for instance, removes redundant severity captions.
  * [#7703](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7703) adds `input_file` and `input_dir` as new target types. It also adds the `needs` configuration option for Lean libraries and executables. This option generalizes `extraDepTargets` (which will be deprecated in the future), providing much richer support for declaring dependencies across package and target type boundaries.
  * [#7716](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7716) adds the `moreLinkObjs` and `moreLinkLibs` options for Lean packages, libraries, and executables. These serves as functional replacements for `extern_lib` and provided additional flexibility.
**Breaking change:** `precompileModules` now only loads modules of the current library individually. Modules of other libraries are loaded together via that library's shared library.
  * [#7732](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7732) deprecates `extraDepTargets` and fixes a bug caused by the configuration refactor.
  * [#7758](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7758) removes the `-lstdcpp` extra link argument from the FFI example. It is not actually necessary.
  * [#7763](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7763) corrects build key fetches to produce jobs with the proper data kinds and fixes a failed coercion from key literals to targets.
